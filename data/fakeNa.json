Kay Ivey, a Republican, tweeted the following: \"We have permanently BANNED Critical Race Theory in Alabama. We’re focused on teaching our children how to read and write, not HATE.\" A Twitter user responded by displaying a photograph that purportedly showed Ivey protesting against desegregation. It was retweeted and liked tens of thousands of times. However, there is no evidence that Ivey appeared in this picture. The same photograph later showed up in a TikTok video. <br> According to Getty Images, the photograph was shot in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Nov. 15, 1960. The official caption read: \"Women at William Franz Elementary School yell at police officers during a protest against desegregation at the school, as three black youngsters attended classes at the school for the second day. Some carry signs stating ‘All I Want For Christmas is a Clean White School’ and ‘Save Segregation Vote, States Rights Pledged Electors.'\" The picture that appeared in the viral tweet told part of the story of Ruby Bridges. According to womenshistory.org, at the time, Bridges was a six-year-old Black girl who \"became the first African American student to integrate an elementary school in the South.\" <br> We found no reporting or other data that linked Ivey to the picture from the viral tweet. Further, according to biographies about her early life, she grew up in the state of Alabama and would have been 16 years old when the photograph was taken. <br> Others pointed out that Ivey appeared in blackface in the past while attending Auburn University, which is true. However, that is a separate claim from the picture that showed people protesting against desegregation in Louisiana, which had nothing to do with her."}

The headline learn, “Missippi’s [sic] literacy program shows improvement,” which referred to the state of Mississippi. The most recent social media post we discovered was from Oct. 18, 2021.<br>This story may call to mind Jay Leno’s previous “Headlines” segment from his late-night present. The weekly bit concerned displaying humorous newspaper clippings for laughs. We didn’t discover the misspelled headline in any of the Leno clips that had been obtainable on YouTube.<br>In accordance with the image, the article under the headline got here from The Related Press (AP). Nonetheless, was the headline additionally written by the AP? This was what we sought to seek out out.<br>For readers who might not be conversant in what the AP does, tales from the wire service are republished on web sites and printed in newspapers throughout the world, together with proper right here on Snopes.com.<br>The next phrases had been additionally seen in the physique of the story: “… and his late wife, Sally, put up $100 million of their own money to improve …” This little bit of textual content helped in the effort to trace down when the physique of the article was first printed.<br>We searched newspaper archives on the useful web site Newspapers.com for the phrases from the physique of the story. The earliest date we landed on was June 12, 2005. It was credited to Related Press journalist Emily Wagster Pettus and printed in The Greenwood Commonwealth, a newspaper in the state of Mississippi. Nonetheless, it had a completely different headline: “Barksdale Reading Institute getting results in schools.” <br>Following June 12, we discovered that the identical story was printed with completely different headlines in fairly a few newspapers.  The commonest headline we noticed was: “Mogul’s literacy investment paying off in poverty-stricken Mississippi schools.”<br>We discovered no newspaper that misspelled the phrase Mississippi as “Missippi.” Additional, we discovered it barely odd that, in line with Google’s search outcomes, the headline image didn’t discover its approach on the web till 5 years later in 2010.<br>It’s attainable that a small newspaper that has not but made obtainable its archives to Newspapers.com by chance printed the misspelled headline. It’s additionally attainable that the headline was printed as slang, one thing that has been written about the phrase “Missippi” earlier than, since some residents in the state pronounce it that approach. The image might even have been doctored by somebody seeking to make a joke.<br>One Reddit person provided an interesting possible explanation of why the headline was spelled the approach it was, though it might be thought-about to be a stretch: “They just shortened Mississippi because there are only two columns. “Missippi” is simply the phonetic spelling for a way they pronounce it down there.” <br>The “Missippi’s literacy program” headline image has been reposted a seemingly endless number of times on Reddit over the years, maybe as a approach to make mild of the state’s nationwide training ranking. One among the posts from June 2019 received greater than 34,500 factors and a whole lot of feedback. For readers unfamiliar with how important that is, it meant that the {photograph} was one in all the prime submissions on the day that it was posted. Fairly a few Reddit customers assumed the obvious error got here from the AP, commenting: “Why would Mississippi be responsible for the AP’s inability to spell Mississippi?” We discovered many more instances the place the AP was blamed for spelling it as “Missippi.” A seek for “Missippi” on Reddit showed a number of reposts with feedback that positioned blame on the AP. We discovered no proof to help the declare that the AP tousled and misspelled Mississippi as “Missippi” in the headline about literacy. Nonetheless, we reached out to each the AP and Pettus, the author of the unique story, for extra data. This declare has been rated as “Research In Progress” and will probably be up to date in the coming days."}

Many times, we just “trust the authorities” on vaccination and don’t ever ask this simple question. Obviously vaccines contain antigens. Aside from that, vaccines contain adjuvants and other chemicals, stabilizers, and preservatives. Antibiotics are added to help prevent contamination during manufacturing. Despite the presence of antibiotics, many vaccines are still contaminated. Other questionable harmful ingredients in vaccines include formaldehyde, mercury, aluminum, and other toxic ingredients.<br>These ingredients make some wary parents concerned about vaccine safety. In today’s world, we are highly conscious about what types of foods we eat and what we give our children. We do our best to avoid toxins and chemicals in our food. Research is still out on the safety of genetically modified food, preservatives and food additives. So we find ourselves spending longer in the grocery isle reading labels, trying to avoid things that are processed or artificial.<br>Harmful Ingredients in Vaccines<br>Mercury is one of the most harmful ingredients in vaccines. A rabbit will die if given a mere 35 mcgs. Many people have mercury amalgam fillings. Having these type fillings complicates matters by creating a build up of mercury in the body. Why on earth are we putting one of the most toxic substances known to man in a vaccine?<br>There are NO safe amounts of mercury established for humans. Children receive combined vaccines that can build up mercury in the body and cause problems. Not one study exists showing it’s safe to inject mercury into humans.<br>Aborted Fetal Tissue in VaccinesVaccines which contain aborted fetal tissue are a concern for some people, especially those who are religious. The irony is, it’s legal to abort a fetus, but if that fetus is born, you are forced by law to inject other aborted fetus’s tissue into your child so that your child can attend school. So a mother’s rights over her child end with abortion.<br>Furthermore, there appears to be a correlation between the uses of aborted human fetal cells with the coincidental rise of autism.<br>Several online articles corroborate that coincidence demonstrating that aborted fetal tissue may be one of the most harmful ingredients in vaccines.<br>We see a spike in autism in 1995 with the introduction of human DNA to the MMR (measles, mumps, ruebella) vaccine, suggesting a possible link. According to Helen Ratajczak, former senior scientist at a pharmaceutical firm, there is a link to brain damage and human DNA in vaccines. DNA in vaccines is taken up by human cells and recombined into their genome.<br>The following is a list of vaccines containing aborted fetal cells:<br>Polio Vaccines, Pentacel, DT Polio Absorbed, Quadracelâ€”all by Sanofi<br>In summary, if we are cognizant about other toxins in our environment, shouldn’t we be taking a deeper look at what’s injected into our children? Vaccines have known neuro-toxins and carcinogens, foreign DNA, aborted fetal cells, and preservatives. Is it a coincidence we have skyrocketing autism, cancer, and chronic illness in our children?"}

But that claim comes with a caveat.<br>The plane could accelerate above the speed of sound only over the ocean. The prospect of noisy sonic booms caused by the plane crossing the sound barrier forced pilots to hold back the throttle above towns and cities after takeoff and before touchdown. “This speed limit actually made the plane much less efficient,” says Karl Wisniewski, director of advanced programs at GE Aviation. “It was designed to fly fast.”<br><br>The last Concorde landed in 2003, but NASA and a team of aerospace companies that includes Lockheed Martin and GE Aviation are not finished with supersonic passenger flight. They are developing a supersonic concept plane that could quietly break the sound barrier without setting off a sonic boom and rattling everyone on the ground.<br><br>The loud noise is the sound of shockwaves set off by an object traveling through air faster than the speed of sound. “We want to know whether there is a level of sonic boom that’s not bothersome to the population,” says Wisniewski. “We are looking for design features that would minimize the perceived noise on the ground.”<br><br>Earlier this year, NASA said it would pay Lockheed about $20 million over the next 17 months to complete a preliminary design for Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST). The first flight of a scaled-down version of the “low boom” plane could take place in 2019. Tests over populated areas could come in the next decade, depending on results and funding.<br><br>Airbus and Boeing are also looking at new supersonic designs.<br><br>NASA said in its news release, “Almost 70 years since Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1 as part of our predecessor agency's high speed research ... we’re continuing that supersonic X-plane legacy with this preliminary design award for a quieter supersonic jet with an aim toward passenger flight.”<br>"}

One patient is dead, and doctors can’t rule out blaming the vaccine. Dr. Gregory Michael – a 56-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who ran his own practice at Miami Beach’s Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than a decade – died in January of a brain hemorrhage. He had received a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine two weeks earlier, and immediately developed immune thrombocytopenia, a rare and sometimes fatal blood disorder.<br>Michael is one of at least 36 people to have developed the condition after receiving either Pfizer’s or Moderna’s coronavirus vaccines, according to a New York Times report published on Monday. The cases were self-reported to the government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) before the end of January, meaning more people could have developed the condition since then.<br>Immune thrombocytopenia is a rare condition affecting an estimated 50,000 people in the US. The condition is caused by the body’s own immune system attacking the platelets that are the component of the blood responsible for clotting. With their blood unable to clot, patients often develop internal or external bruising, which may look like a rash. In several cases like Michael’s, the condition has caused massive hemorrhages or strokes.<br>One patient contacted by the Times suffered heavy vaginal bleeding two weeks after receiving Moderna’s vaccine and required platelet transfusions and steroid treatment to survive. Another woman was hospitalized with bruising and bleeding blisters in her mouth just a day after receiving the same shot. Her condition deteriorated to the point where doctors concerned that a slight knock would trigger fatal bleeding were afraid to move her from the hospital bed.<br>The cases can’t all conclusively be linked with the vaccines, but Dr. James Bussel, a hematologist and expert on the condition, told the Times that an association “is possible.”<br>“Having it happen after a vaccine is well-known and has been seen with many other vaccines,” he said. “Why it happens, we don’t know.”<br>Unlike traditional vaccines, which use an inactive form of the pathogen they protect against, both Pfizer’s and Moderna’s offerings are mRNA vaccines. Technologically new and therefore untested on a mass basis, these vaccines work by introducing into the body’s cells a strand of RNA with instructions that tell the person’s DNA how to begin making antibodies.<br>Researchers at Cambridge University state that side effects could include “autoimmune reactions,” but Harvard scientists say that mRNA vaccines produce “a stronger type of immunity” than their traditional counterparts.<br>Immune thrombocytopenia can also develop as a result of certain medications and cancers, from influenza, and seemingly from Covid-19 itself. As early as last spring, long before any vaccines were near completion, doctors in the US, Europe, India and China noticed the condition in Covid patients and suspected a link.<br>Officials with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that they are investigating the VAERS reports, while both Pfizer and Moderna told the Times that they are monitoring the safety of their vaccines.<br>Doctors contacted by the Times still insist that vaccination is safe, and that the risk of developing serious illness from the coronavirus is still higher than the risk of side effects from the vaccine."}

Council voted to replace it with Indigenous Peoples' Day in a temporary move that it hopes to make permanent. Several other places across the United States have also made the switch in a growing movement to end the celebration of the Italian explorer in favor of honoring Indigenous communities and their resiliency in the face of violence by European explorers like Christopher Columbus.<br><br>Baley Champagne is responsible for that change in her home state of Louisiana. The tribal citizen of the United Houma Nation petitioned the governor, John Bel Edwards, to change the day. He did, along with several other states this year.<br>There's no comprehensive list of places that have switched, but at least 10 states now celebrate some version of Indigenous Peoples' Day on the second Monday in October, like Hawaii's Discoverers' Day or South Dakota's Native Americans' Day. Many college campuses have dumped Columbus Day for Indigenous Peoples' Day as have more than 100 cities, towns and counties across the country.<br><br>For Native Americans, Columbus Day has long been hurtful. It conjures the violent history of 500 years of colonial oppression at the hands of European explorers and those who settled here — a history whose ramifications and wounds still run deep today.<br><br>The shift isn't happening without some pushback. For many Italian Americans, Columbus Day is their day to celebrate Italian heritage and the contributions of Italian Americans to the United States. It was adopted at a time when Italians were vilified and faced religious and ethnic discrimination. The first commemoration came in 1892, a year after a mass lynching of 11 Italian Americans by a mob in New Orleans. Italian Americans latched onto the day as a way to mainstream and humanize themselves in the face of rampant discrimination. It became a national holiday in 1934 to honor a man who, ironically, never set foot in the United States. Columbus anchored in the Bahamas.<br><br>For many Italian Americans, Columbus Day isn't just about the man but about what the day represents: a people searching for safety and acceptance in their new home.<br><br>In 2017, after someone vandalized the Christopher Columbus statue in New York City's Central Park, the then-president and chief operating officer of the National Italian American Foundation, John M. Viola, wrote in a New York Times editorial,<br>Speed says she recognizes the importance of celebrating the history and contributions of Italian Americans, but there has to be another way to honor them.<br>There are a lot of Italian Americans who very much support the shift to Indigenous Peoples' Day because they don't want to feel themselves associated with a man who is known to have committed terrible crimes against humanity, she said. Italian Americans were greatly discriminated against in this country, and it's incredibly important to have a day to celebrate that heritage. It just shouldn't be around the figure of Columbus.<br>Celebrating Columbus, she said, not only whitewashes a violent history but also discounts the further trauma that honoring him inflicts on Indigenous people.<br>"}

So can Christians sign up for a jab exemption now?","date":"8 October 2021","body":"For billions of faithful around the world, abortion is considered first-degree murder, yet fetal tissue is being used to develop Covid vaccines. While some may argue that ‘killing a life to save millions’ is fine, many disagree.<br>For those who rely on the mainstream media to keep astride of current affairs, chances are slim you’ve heard the story of Melissa Strickler. That’s too bad because Miss Strickler, Pfizer’s quality auditor, just unloaded a batch of company emails that show company executives being less than honest at a time when the Biden administration – as well as other governments around the world – is enforcing mandatory vaccines on millions of their citizens.<br><br>What makes Strickler’s revelations so startling is that Pfizer is instructing staff to obfuscate the truth over the use of aborted fetal cells in the development of its vaccines. This latest slap in the face to the faithful stings much more than closing down churches during a pandemic.<br><br>In one damning email, Vanessa Gelman, Pfizer’s senior director of worldwide research, said ‘we want to avoid having the information on fetal cells floating out there,’ before adding that the ‘risk of communicating this… outweighs any potential benefit we could see, particularly with general members of the public who may take this information and use it in ways we may not want out there…’<br><br>Like maybe working with a whistleblower, for example? Gelman failed to see that ugly prospect hurling down the pipe, which certainly ‘outweighs any potential benefit’ of Pfizer simply being upfront with the public. <br><br>In another Pfizer communication, an employee asked for advice on how to respond to the very straightforward question: ‘Did Pfizer make use of a cell line from an aborted foetus when carrying out any confirmatory tests for this vaccine?’<br><br>Instead of a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, Gelman advised to ‘stay focused’ on the company line of horse manure, which reads: ‘Human fetal derived cell lines are not used to produce our investigational vaccine, which consists of synthetic and enzymatically produced components.’<br><br>In the very next sentence, however, Gelman veers 180 degrees from her original statement, telling staff not to share with the public the following information unless it’s ‘strictly necessary’: ‘One or more cell lines with an origin that can be traced back to human fetal tissue has been used in laboratory tests associated with the vaccine program.’<br><br>In other words, Pfizer is talking out of both sides of its mouth at a time when its vaccines are projected to earn the drug maker $33.5 billion in revenue in 2021 now that forced mandates have taken the world by storm. The last thing that Pfizer wants at this stage in the game, of course, is for millions of Christians, as well as adherents of other faiths, to start asking questions about aborted fetal tissue in its product.<br><br>Presently, however, the drug maker has kept the vaccine heretics at bay thanks to none other than the divine intervention of Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church. That much was evident in an email by Philip Dormitzer, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer, who, after spilling the beans that the vaccines are ‘ultimately derived from an aborted fetus,’ proudly proclaims that ‘the Vatican doctrinal committee has confirmed that they consider it acceptable for Pro-Life believers to be immunized.’<br><br>‘Pfizer’s official statement couches the answer well and is what should be provided in response to an outside inquiry,’ he adds smugly.<br>"}

But WHO officials now say that while asymptomatic spread can occur, it is not the main way it’s being transmitted. <br>“From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said at a news briefing from the United Nations agency’s Geneva headquarters. “It’s very rare.”<br>The virus is primarily spread via respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes or if they touch a contaminated surface, scientists say. <br>Asymptomatic transmission is particularly worrisome for public health officials, leading many to institute severe lockdowns and policies requiring masks in public. That’s because those patients never develop symptoms and, in many cases, don’t even know they are infected. WHO officials say Covid-19 can also spread in the so-called pre-symptomatic stage — a few days before a patient shows symptoms. <br>WATCH NOW<br>VIDEO03:06<br>WHO: Coronavirus patients who don’t show symptoms aren’t driving the spread of the virus<br>Van Kerkhove said government officials should still focus on detecting and isolating infected people with symptoms, and tracking anyone who might have come into contact with them. The WHO also revised its guidance on masks last week, saying they should be worn in public places, especially on public transportation and in densely populated areas. She acknowledged that some studies have indicated that there’s been asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread in nursing homes and in household settings.<br>More research and data are needed to “truly answer” the question of whether the coronavirus can spread widely through asymptomatic carriers, Van Kerkhove added.<br>“We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing,” she said. “They’re following asymptomatic cases. They’re following contacts. And they’re not finding secondary transmission onward. It’s very rare.”<br>Research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contradicts Kerkhove’s statement. An April 1 report from the CDC cited the “potential for presymptomatic transmission” as a reason for the importance of social distancing.

{"id":16,"title":"Vaccines Can Cause Infertility","date":"July 20, 2013","body":"I have been investigating whether there is a proven link between vaccines and infertility. What I have uncovered will shock many readers because I have discovered that innocent women and girls in developing countries have been deliberately experimented on, with the use of infertility vaccines, for many years.<br><br>They are not the only victims. Recently several vaccines used worldwide have also been found to cause infertility, including the HPV vaccines and many of the swine flu vaccines.<br><br>My interest in the subject began after it was reported that the Japanese government had decided to withdraw its support for the HPV vaccine schedule. This decision came after the government received approximately 2000 reports from women and girls suffering adverse reactions, including long-term pain, numbness, paralysis and infertility. [1]<br><br>This does not mean that Japan has banned or suspended the program, as the vaccines will still be available to anyone wishing to receive them. However, the medical provider will automatically inform anyone wishing to receive the HPV vaccines Gardasil or Cervarix that the Japanese government no longer supports the HPV vaccine program.<br><br>This Shot Changed One Girl’s Life Forever<br>Over the years, a range of adverse reactions have been reported worldwide after the HPV vaccinations. However, the discovery that the HPV vaccine has been found to cause infertility in some women has only been publicized more recently.<br><br>In 2012, the British Medical Journal published a paper by Dr. Deidrie Little titled Premature Ovarian Failure 3 Years After Menarche in a 16 Year-Old Girl Following Human Papillomavirus Vaccination, in which Dr. Little detailed the case of a sixteen year-old girl suffering from premature menopause after receiving the HPV vaccine Gardasil. The summary of the paper states:<br><br>‘Premature ovarian failure in a well adolescent is a rare event. Its occurrence raises important questions about causation, which may signal other systemic concerns. This patient presented with amenorrhoea after identifying a change from her regular cycle to irregular and scant periods following vaccinations against human papillomavirus. She declined the oral contraceptives initially prescribed for amenorrhoea. The diagnostic tasks were to determine the reason for her secondary amenorrhoea and then to investigate for possible causes of the premature ovarian failure identified.<br><br>Although the cause is unknown in 90% of cases, the remaining chief identifiable causes of this condition were excluded. Premature ovarian failure was then notified as a possible adverse event following this vaccination. The young woman was counselled regarding preservation of bone density, reproductive implications and relevant follow-up. This event could hold potential implications for population health and prompts further inquiry.’ [2]<br><br>As the BMJ charges a fee to read their articles, interested readers can find a report about the case on the Weekly Briefing of the Population Research Institute’s website. The report states that Dr. Little said that before the sixteen year-old received the vaccine Gardasil during the fall of 2008, her menstrual cycle was perfectly normal. However, by January 2009, her cycle had become irregular, and over the course of the next two years, her menses (bleeds) had become increasingly irregular. By 2011, she had ceased menstruating altogether.<br><br>The Weekly Briefing stated:<br><br>‘In the Australian case, after testing the levels of numerous hormones, and the function of various internal organs, the girl was diagnosed by Dr. Little as having ‘premature ovarian failure’, which is defined as ‘the presence of menopausal gonadotrophin levels in association with over 3 months of amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea before age 40 years.’<br><br>Further testing confirmed that all of her eggs—every last one—were dead. She was and is totally and irrevocably infertile.’<br><br>The Weekly Briefing article has since been removed, but a complete copy of the article can be found on several websites, including Population Research Institute. [3]<br><br>[adrotate banner=‘9″]<br><br>Thousands of Women Are Now Infertile Because of Vaccines<br>It is extremely unusual for a girl of this age to enter early menopause. So, we must ask ourselves, was it the vaccine that caused her symptoms or was it something else?<br><br>I decided to research if there were any other reports or papers on the subject of vaccination and infertility. I was horrified by what I discovered.<br><br>I found a total of 56 research papers listed on PubMed relating to contraceptive vaccines, dating as far back as 1977. No doubt a researcher entering a range of different search terms could come up with many more. <br><br>This led me to question whether or not vaccines were being manufactured deliberately to cause infertility. One paper in particular, published in 1989, written by G.P. Talwar and R. Raghupathy titled Anti-Fertility Vaccines appears to suggest that they are. The authors stated:<br><br>‘Vaccines are under development for the control of fertility in males and females. This review discusses developments in anti-fertility vaccines at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India.<br><br>A single injection procedure for the sterilization or castration of male animals depending on the site at which the injection is given, has passed through field testing and is expected to be on the market in the near future.’ [5]<br><br>It is difficult to judge from this abstract whether these vaccines were being developed for use on humans or animals. However, further research has led me to believe that these vaccines were being developed for humans, because not long after this paper was published, vaccines were administered to women and children in a number of countries, including Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines, causing many of them to become infertile.<br><br>Why Weren’t Men or Boys Given This ‘Tetanus’ Vaccine?<br>In 1994, the World Health Organization gave many women in developing countries aged between 15 and 45 a tetanus vaccine containing a birth control drug.<br><br>An organization known as The Comite became suspicious of the protocols surrounding the vaccines and obtained several vials for testing. It was discovered that some of the vials contained human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a naturally occurring hormone essential for maintaining a pregnancy.<br><br>However, when combined with a tetanus toxoid carrier, this vaccine essentially causes a woman’s body to produce antibodies against pregnancy, forcing her body to abort her unborn baby. The ThinkTwice Global Vaccine Institute, reporting on the story, stated:<br><br>‘In nature the hCG hormone alerts the woman’s body that she is pregnant and causes the release of other hormones to prepare the uterine lining for the implantation of the fertilized egg. The rapid rise in hCG levels after conception makes it an excellent marker for confirmation of pregnancy: when a woman takes a pregnancy test she is not tested for the pregnancy itself, but for the elevated presence of hCG.<br><br>However, when introduced into the body coupled with a tetanus toxoid carrier, antibodies will be formed not only against tetanus but also against hCG. In this case the body fails to recognize hCG as a friend and will produce anti-hCG antibodies. The antibodies will attack subsequent pregnancies by killing the hCG which naturally sustains a pregnancy; when a woman has sufficient anti-hCG antibodies in her system, she is rendered incapable of maintaining a pregnancy.’ [6]<br><br>Curiously, no men, boys or babies were vaccinated during the program. The only people vaccinated with this particular vaccine were women aged between 15 and 45. Was it a coincidence that these vaccines were only given to women of childbearing age? After all, anyone can contract tetanus, can’t they?<br><br>If The Comite had not become suspicious, then no one would have been any wiser. However, the question now remains: Was this a deliberate attempt by the WHO to reduce the population? The answer may lay in a paper written in 1997."}

{"id":17,"title":"FDA approves Pfizer jab for kids, but even they don’t seem sure it’s safe","date":"1 Nov, 2021","body":"American children have no choice but to act as experimental test subjects for the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to determine the jab’s safety, the Food and Drug Administration has apparently concluded. Good luck, kids!<br>‘We’re never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it,’ editor of the New England Journal of Medicine and Harvard adjunct professor Eric Rubin argued last week, his words buried within the eight-hour barrage of presentations and discussions that swirled around the FDA advisory panel's approval of the mRNA jab for children aged five to 11. <br><br>The FDA followed up on the advisory panel’s 17-0 recommendation with approval, as it typically does, on Friday. If the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention follows suit, some 28 million American children will be quickly served up as fresh-faced fodder for a smaller dose of the Covid-19 vaccine already poised to inject some 100 million American adults. That is, as soon as President Joe Biden is able to whip up a legally-binding demand he can submit to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<br>Friday’s FDA approval means only the CDC stands between American children and a warp-speed rollout of the Pfizer jab. However, the rush to approval doesn’t necessarily mean there are no concerns. A disturbingly large portion of the FDA committee’s members are connected to Pfizer in some way or another, leading vaccine skeptics to cry foul. Meanwhile, a growing portion of the country continues to denounce the mandates in general, insisting everyone should be able to make their own decision regarding whether or not they wish to get injected. <br><br>Echoing the newly-reanimated pro-choice slogan, mandate protesters recently swarmed the Brooklyn Bridge declaring ‘My body, my choice’ as New York City employees faced the potential loss of their jobs as firefighters, police officers, sanitation handlers, and corrections officers due to Mayor Bill de Blasio’s insistence that all municipal employees get vaxxed or be relegated to the purgatory of open-ended unpaid leave.<br><br>The FDA’s effort to put the cart so far in front of the horse mirrored the words of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the congressional tug-of-war over Obamacare in 2010. Faced with a phonebook-sized, dubiously-legal bill unlike anything Congress had passed before and no realistic timeframe to wrangle with the details, Pelosi suggested Congress would have to ‘pass the bill to find out what’s in it, away from the fog of controversy.’<br>Since then, legislation by brute force has only grown as the means by which laws are passed in the US, as ever-more-polarized parties refuse to give an inch and betray the appearance of weakness. Allowing the ‘other side’ to be seen as achieving even the slightest victory is unconscionable, and that framework remains in place in the vaccination arena – where it makes less sense than anywhere else.<br><br>After all, it was former President Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed that brought the world the Pfizer shot, even if the jab itself wasn’t rolled out until shortly (some would say deliberately) after the 2020 election and vaccine mandates have since become a cause celebre of the Democratic Party. <br><br>With half the US up in arms about the other half’s supposed refusal to roll up its sleeves and submit to an intensely politicized needle, anyone who hesitates is denounced posthaste in a 21st-century witch hunt – to be fired, if not set on fire; outfitted with the scarlet A for anti-vaxxer, not adulteress; and otherwise chased out of the public square – deplatformed from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, if not chased physically with pitchforks and torches. Similar divisions have erupted across Europe, and countries like Italy and France have pushed the issue even further, barring the unvaccinated from so much as entering grocery stores to buy food.<br><br>While the US study of the Pfizer vaccine’s effects on children five to 11 failed to turn up any deadly side effects, critics argued its population size was too small to be effective for such a purpose. Parents of some jab recipients have observed disturbing symptoms in their offspring in the hours and days following the shots and filmed heartbreaking testimonials describing their downfall from healthy children to pain-wracked perma-patients experiencing near-constant seizures, facial distortions, debilitating heart problems, or other dire health issues."}

It’s normally sold as an edible paste or a sterile solution for injection into cattle and other livestock. The drug is FDA-approved for certain treatments, although not yet FDA approved for treatment of COVID-19. We are not recommending it for human consumption until more data are available.<br><br>The study, found here, is entitled, ‘The FDA-approved Drug Ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.’<br><br><br>The abstract of the study describes the very strong potential of Ivermectin to inhibit viral replication in vitro. This was not a human clinical trial, of course, but the results make Ivermectin an immediate candidate for further study:<br><br>We report here that Ivermectin, an FDA-approved anti-parasitic previously shown to have broad-spectrum anti-viral activity in vitro, is an inhibitor of the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2), with a single addition to Vero-hSLAM cells 2 hours post infection with SARS-CoV-2 able to effect ?5000-fold reduction in viral RNA at 48 h. Ivermectin therefore warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans.<br><br>Ivermectin is well known to exhibit strong anti-viral properties and is even documented to inhibit HIV replication. This is important to note, since the Wuhan coronavirus, an engineered biological weapon, uses HIV components as part of its infection and replication machinery. As described in the abstract:<br><br>Ivermectin is an FDA-approved broad spectrum anti-parasitic agent that in recent years we, along with other groups, have shown to have anti-viral activity against a broad range of viruses in vitro. Originally identified as an inhibitor of interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase protein (IN) and the importin (IMP) ?/?1 heterodimer responsible for IN nuclear import, Ivermectin has since been confirmed to inhibit IN nuclear import and HIV-1 replication.<br><br>According to the published study, Ivermectin is known to inhibit the replication of:<br><br>Simian virus (SV40), which was placed into polio vaccines for many years in the United States.<br>Dengue virus (DENV)<br>West Nile Virus<br>Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)<br>Influenza<br>Pseudorabies virus (PRV)<br>‘Essentially all viral material’ was gone within 48 hours<br>Study authors describe how a single dose of Ivermectin achieved a 93% reduction of viral RNA was achieved within just 24 hours, with ‘essentially all viral material’ gone in 48 hours.<br><br>At 24 h, there was a 93% reduction in viral RNA present in the supernatant (indicative of released virions) of samples treated with ivermectin compared to the vehicle DMSO. Similarly a 99.8% reduction in cell-associated viral RNA (indicative of unreleased and unpackaged virions) was observed with ivermectin treatment. By 48h this effect increased to an ?5000-fold reduction of viral RNA in ivermectin-treated compared to control samples, indicating that ivermectin treatment resulted in the effective loss of essentially all viral material by 48 h.<br><br>Furthermore, no toxicity was observed in the testing so far:<br><br>As we have observed previously no toxicity of ivermectin was observed at any of the timepoints tested, in either the sample wells or in parallel tested drug alone samples.<br><br>We now add Ivermectin to the list of candidates for low-cost, readily available treatments and possible cures<br>It’s criminal that Dr. Fauci and the Big Pharma establishment won’t talk about low-cost prescription drugs (like hydroxychloroquine) or simple nutritional supplements (zinc) that are available now and have a long track record of safe, effective use. Instead, they want the world to suffer and die while demanding we all wait for a vaccine that may or may not work.<br><br>In the context of this global pandemic, the active censorship of alternative treatments is nothing less than a crime against humanity.<br><br>Here are the drugs and nutrients we now list as the best candidates for urgent clinical trials, as these may turn out to be highly effective treatments or even cures for the coronavirus, especially in combination:<br><br>Hydroxychloroquine<br>Zinc<br>Vitamin D<br>IV vitamin C therapy<br>Ivermectin<br>Note that two out of the five on the list are FDA-approved prescription drugs. With trillions of dollars being thrown around as bailout money, we aren’t we spending just a few million dollars to run clinical trials on these low-cost candidates?<br><br>The answer, of course, is money. Big Pharma wants to skim big money off the pandemic, and they can’t earn billions from off-patent, generic prescription drugs like hydroxychloroquine.<br><br>We are now watching the entire world be strangled to death by Big Pharma because they don’t want a natural substance or a low-cost drug to be the ‘hero’ of this story. They want to roll out mandatory vaccines, which means they must suppress all other therapies until they have their vaccines ready (with the medical police state vaccine tracking chips installed on everyone, to boot).<br><br>That’s why I say the people dying from coronavirus right now aren’t merely dying from coronavirus alone: They’re dying from ignorance that has been put in place by Big Tech censorship, Big Pharma disinformation and the pharma-controlled fake news media establishment that suppresses truthful information about treatments that could be working right now.<br><br>In fact, I’ve written an article about how we can end the lockdowns right now and get everybody back to work by simply invoking four strategies to halt the spread of the virus."}

Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression.

Bill Lee for supposedly signing an executive order giving the National Guard the authority to build ‘quarantine camps’ in the state in which to lock up those who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19.<br><br>Locke, who has long been an unhinged opponent of efforts to control the spread of COVID-19, recently announced that anyone caught wearing a mask in his church would be ejected. On Sunday, he used his sermon to rail against Gov. Lee for signing an executive order easing some regulations in the state so health officials can better and more quickly deal with rising infection and hospitalization rates.<br><br>‘Do you see this nonsense our governor signed?’ Locke fumed. ‘[He] will not get reelected because, I’m telling you, he is a coward. I don’t care how much he talks about Jesus; Bill Lee is a coward. You tell him I said so. He’s a noodle. He’s a waffler. Willy nilly nonsense. Opening up Tennessee to this bunch of craziness going on. I ain’t voting for him again. I’m ashamed I voted for him the first time.’<br><br>‘Did you see the executive order he just signed for COVID-19?’ Locke continued. ‘Anybody that has a medical license can now practice in Tennessee from out of state, which is unconstitutional, super, super dangerous, and that is very unlawful for a lot of reasons. But they’re talking about all these hospitals are overflowing with people. Why don’t you carry camera in one of these hospitals that are supposed to be overflowing with COVID patients and show me how empty they are?’<br><br>‘But here’s the two things that bothered me,’ Locke said. ‘Number one: He has authorized the power of the National Guard to get involved in issues of COVID-19. … You know what bothers me more about the National Guard getting involved? Why don’t you look at Section 8 of what he signed? … They’ve authorized the Tennessee Department of FEMA to build what they call—in his own authorized pages of a signature—quarantine camps.

This month and next, Earth is catching up with Mars in an encounter that will culminate in the closest approach between the two planets in recorded history. Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye. Mars will be easy to spot. At the beginning of August it will rise in the east at 10p.m. and reach its azimuth at about 3 a.m.... Share this with your children and grandchildren. NO ONE ALIVE TODAY WILL EVER SEE THIS AGAIN.<br>Mars will be brighter than it has been in thousands of years and even that it will be as big as the full Moon. Neither of these statements is true. However, Mars will be very bright and easy to observe during the fall of this year (it is currently visible in the pre-dawn sky, but will get much brighter). Also, in 2003, it was closer than it had been in tens of thousands of years. Here are some of the facts about 2005<br>1. Mars will be closest to Earth in 2005 on October 29 or 30, depending on your time zone.<br>2. Because of the combination of Earth and Mars' orbital periods, Mars and Earth grow closer every 26 months. Even then, they are still many tens of millions of kilometers (or miles) away from each other.<br>3. Martian close approaches vary a lot in brightness because Mars' orbit is much more elliptical (less circular) than Earth's. So, sometimes we are close to it when it is in the part of its orbit that is nearest the Sun, and sometimes when it is farthest in its orbit from the Sun.<br>4. Mars was closer to Earth in the 2003 close approach than it had been in tens of thousands of years, but not by much compared to approaches that happened tens of years ago.<br>5. In 2005, Mars will be farther than it was in 2003, but it will still be a very good apparition. It will get brighter than the brightest star in the sky, but not nearly as bright as Venus. It will still be great to go out and see. (It will be brighter than -2 magnitudes for those who are familiar with that system of brightness.)<br>6. Mars never appears large enough to appear as more than a point of light to the naked eye (certainly not coming anywhere near the apparent size of the Moon in our sky).<br>7. Mars will be about 20 arcseconds across during this close approach, which is about 5 arcseconds smaller than in 2003. But, the disk will be quite clear in almost any small telescope. A nice amateur telescope should allow you to see at least a polar cap and some light and dark markings on the surface. It will be southern summer on Mars, however, and the south pole will be tilted towards us, so the southern polar cap will be small.<br>A number of sites around the Web will give more information, especially as we get closer to October. You can also listen to Planetary Radio, http://planetary.org/radio where in the last several minutes of each show we cover easy things to look for in the night sky.<br><br>"}

Now, we are being told that:<br><br>— Life isn’t going to return to normal because there’s a new ‘variant’ called Delta making its way around the country; and<br><br>— The vaccines we were promised were nearly 95 percent effective…aren’t against this ‘new variant.’<br><br>But alas, something is amiss as new mask mandates are being imposed and there are rising numbers of ‘breakthrough’ infections even among vaccinated Americans.<br><br>‘New recommendations from federal health officials this week on when vaccinated Americans should don face masks came with a startling bolt of news: People who have had their shots and become infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus can harbor large amounts of virus just like unvaccinated people,’ the Houston Chronicle reported this week.<br><br>‘That means they could become spreaders of the disease and should return to wearing masks indoors in certain situations, including when vulnerable people are present,’ the paper added.<br><br>As if this information isn’t conflicting enough, we have bad messaging coming out of the Biden regime as well, which is nothing new.<br><br>For starters, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administrator Dr. Rochelle Walensky took to CNN Wednesday to tell Americans that are vaccinated they must begin wearing masks again in ‘orange and red’ zones where the variant is highest…because of unvaccinated people.<br><br>When she got pushback from CNN co-host John Berman, Walensky explained that hey, can’t be helped, this new version is infecting even some vaccinated people.<br><br>‘The science that prompted [the] guidance is just days old, and in the coming days you will actually see the published information on the science that motivated’ the sudden change in masking policy, she said.<br><br>Berman responded by clarifying with Walensky that the new infections were ‘primarily coming from unvaccinated people to unvaccinated people,’ to which Walensky agreed.<br><br>‘So then, you can understand the frustration in those of us who are vaccinated saying, ‘Why the hell do I have to pay the price for this?’’ Berman said.<br><br>‘Right. So we’re asking everybody in those areas of orange and red to mask up,’ Walensky responded.<br><br>‘Here is the reason why — if you’re a vaccinated person and you’re in one of those areas, as you said, a sea of red, a sea of COVID, you have a reasonably high chance, if nobody is wearing a mask, to interact with people who may be infectious,’ she continued. ‘Every 20 vaccinated people, one or two of them could get a breakthrough infection. … They may only get mild disease, but we wanted them to know that they could bring that mild disease home,’ she added. ‘They could bring it to others.’<br><br>Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters the same day that all people needed to do was to ‘get vaccinated’ and they’d be just fine, as Fox News host Tucker Carlson pointed out on his show this week.<br><br>‘If you’re looking for a single snapshot that perfectly distills the pure, hallucinogenic absurdity of the moment we’re living in, consider the Biden administration’s new guidance on COVID,’ Carlson said. ‘The administration now says that all people, including people who have been vaccinated, will have to wear masks, but only depending on where they live.’<br><br>What’s adding to the confusion — and suspicion — as the Houston Chronicle noted, is that the CDC didn’t publish the new research upon which its masking guidance is being based.<br><br>No wonder a growing number of Americans no longer trust a single government agency."}

Thomas Renz, an attorney based in Ohio has started a lawsuit against the federal government for covering up the true number of deaths from the Covid-19 vaccines.<br><br>According to Renz, a whistle-blower – referred to as Jane Doe – who is an insider and has seen information on the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) allegedly passed on the numbers and relevant information to him.<br><br>At an event hosted by Awaken America, Renz said: ‘We have someone that has sworn under penalty of purgery that there have been at least 45,000 deaths.’<br><br>Renz stated that whilst he cannot currently prove the information, he said that with America’s Frontline Doctors – a team of medical professionals fighting for medical freedom for Americans – he has been ‘empowered’ to file the lawsuit in Alabama.<br><br>Allegedly, the whistleblower stated that there are around 11 VAERS systems reporting adverse reactions and deaths across the US, and one system alone has allegedly has reported the shocking 45,000 deaths from the Covid jabs.<br><br>However, Renz believes that this number is ‘immensely higher’ and is calling for immediate investigations into the VAERS system.<br><br>‘How many have really died and why are they covering it up?’, Renz told the Awaken America crowd.<br><br>The attorney said that this information and lawsuit will not be reported by the mainstream media and will likely be censored by big tech corporations like YouTube, Facebook, and Google.<br><br>Renz said that these big tech giants are ‘complicit in causing death’, and that he cannot wait to sue them ‘over and over again.’<br><br>Through his Ohio-based law firm, Renz Law, Thomas is suing the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to halt the Covid-19 vaccine rollout to children 15-years-old and younger.<br><br>The lawsuit was filed by Renz and his legal team alongside America’s Frontline Doctors against the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) of the Covid-19 vaccines, which they state have had ‘no long-term studies on the impact on adults, much less children.’<br><br>Furthermore, the lawsuit challenges the legality of EUA as the law states that children must be at risk, which Renz argues that the ‘CDC state that children are statistically at ZERO percent mortality rate by Covid-19.’<br><br>Recent data from VAERS up to the week of July 2nd showed that 29.5% of all reported deaths in the US following the administration of the Covid-19 over the last six months and two weeks occurred in the last week.<br><br>The data showed that between December 14th, 2020, and July 2nd, 2021, a total of 438,441 adverse events were reported to VAERS, including 9,048 deaths. Compared to the previous week, this was an increase of 2,063 deaths.<br><br>However, it is known that only 1% of adverse reactions are reported, as a report commissioned by the US Department of Health stated that: ‘Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but under-reported.<br><br>‘Although 25% of ambulatory patients experience an adverse drug event, less than 0.3% of all adverse drug events and 1-13% of serious events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported.’<br><br>Therefore, it is worth noting that the adverse reaction statistics are already inaccurate as not every person who has an adverse event reports it to the relevant system. However, the question still remains as to the number of reactions and deaths which may not be released to the public by the likes of VAERS and the UK’s Yellow Card reporting system.<br><br>Whilst the shocking information revealed by the whistleblower cannot yet be proven, it will be interesting to see how the lawsuit develops and what unfolds as a result."}

And the nearby ducks that were swimming seemed to react very oddly as well; they were simultaneously putting their heads underwater to escape the radiation while others flew away, landing on the street or in the canal.<br>Again, almost at the exact same time that those animals died, near the station, Holland Spoor was tested with a 5G transmitter mast.<br>“If they all got heart-failure with an healthy body, no signs of any virus, no bacterial infection, healthy blood, no poisons found etc. etc. The only reasonable explanation is, that it is from the new 5G Microwaves having an huge effect of all birds hearts! … It heavily resonates with certain ERRATIC PULSED Microwaves (millions per second!) which can be proven to have biological effects on organs! … Am not kidding here! …<br>“Some people assume Microwaves at lower wattage “can not harm” because “it does not cook you” … that very flawed “logic” is what they want you to repeat over and over! … Search in “Google Scholar Search Site”: Biological Effects of Non-ionizing Microwaves and be ready to be shocked how stupid most sheeple really are in believing blindly the so called “experts” & ” authorities” of FCC, Telecom & Wireless Industry propaganda!” — John Kuhles, founder of Fb.com/groups/Stop5G & Fb.me/Stop5Gowner of Stop5G.net<br>This wasn’t proof though. It was initially just conjecture.<br>All the information that follows comes from John Kuhles’ public Facebook page (not being a native English speaker, I have cleaned a little of it up but mostly left it intact for you):<br>In the meantime (30-10-2018) received some more information. The birds that fell massively dead would be the victims of an experiment, performed on those days in The Hague, where RF radiation was tested with a peak frequency of 7.40 GHz. This information comes from one source and should still be confirmed, if possible.<br>It is not clear at this moment whether tests with 5G transmission masts have been carried out again, but so far everything points in the direction of 5G as the most probable cause.<br>Earlier, crazy things happened, such as with cows in Groningen’s Loppersum last year, where it was also tested with 5G. But also how in Switzerland a complete herd of cows collapsed in a ravine when there was tested with 5G.<br>Source 1: MSN.com<br>Oct. 26, 2018<br><br>In the Huijgenspark in The Hague, more than a hundred starlings have fallen dead from the trees in recent days. It is a mystery what happened to the animals.<br>The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) is having a number of birds examined in the laboratory of Wageningen Bioveterinary Research. Parts of the park are blocked and dogs are no longer allowed to be let out. The dead birds are always cleaned up as quickly as possible. Yet it is a lugubrious scene.<br>Council member Robert Barker of the Party for the Animals had the feeling of being on a ‘crime scene’. “The fact that so many birds fall from the sky at this location must have a cause and must be investigated. If there is talk of poisoning, then we have to take a hard time. ”<br>It is also possible that the birds have a disease. “In any case, it’s going fast. The animals are not emaciated, do not seem ill. They just fall dead from the tree, “says employee Sharon Lexmond of bird shelter De Wulp.<br>A possible link was established between 5G trials in Groningen and the ‘crazy cows there, as they were called, see: Stopumts.nl<br>Further info from Facebook:<br>Trondheim (3rd city of Norway) also attacked the birds. After 6 months there was no toxicological report yet. It has also happened in Sweden, Australia, United States. Nyhetsspeilet.no<br>In the meantime (30-10-2018) received some more information. The birds that fell massively dead would be the victims of an experiment, performed on those days in The Hague, where RF radiation was tested with a peak frequency of 7.40 GHz, which corresponds to a wavelength of 4.05 cm.<br>This wavelength is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the starlings. This may be important because of possible resonance effects. The mast in question is about 400 meters from where the starlings have fallen dead. This information comes from one source and should still be confirmed, if possible.<br>Source 2: https://www.rtlnieuws.nl<br>Mysterious bird deaths in The Hague: dead starlings fall massively from the sky<br>Oct. 26, 2018<br>￼<br>For several days in a row, dead starlings fall from the sky in the Huijgenspark in The Hague. It is estimated that around 150 birds have already lost their lives. What is the cause of this is being investigated?<br>The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, the Dutch Wildlife Health Center and a Wageningen University laboratory are investigating the cause of death of the starlings. A veterinarian of bird care De Wulp performed a number of birds last week. She only found internal bleeding and no trace of poison.<br>Contaminated water…<br>”Last year we had the same situation at the Haagse Hogeschool, where it was renovated at the time ”, says an employee of the Animal Ambulance.” Then dozens of dead jackdaws were found, which were probably poisoned because they had been drinking polluted water. What is going on right now is really speculating. Hopefully, we know more next week, because this is not normal. ”<br>No trace of poison.<br>Source 3: Dierenhospitaal and Dierenambulance The Hague<br>Again, dead starlings have been found in the Huijgenspark in The Hague. More than ninety dead birds were spread across the park in the Stationsbuurt.<br>We took the birds. Last time, five of the deceased starlings were examined by a local specialist. It did not show signs of poison, but only internal bleeding in two copies. The newly found starlings are examined by the specialized Wageningen Bioveterinary Research laboratory in Lelystad and the Dutch Wildlife Health Center in Utrecht.<br>The municipality has promulgated a ban on dogs in the area because the cause of the mortality is unclear. Poisoning is taken into account. The area has been blocked by the police.<br><br>Source 4: Birdcare the curlew<br>Oct. 26, 2018<br>How is the current state of affairs with regard to the dead starlings?<br>Last Friday, Wednesday and Thursday, a total of +/- 150 deceased starlings were found in the Huijgenspark in The Hague. On Sunday, Thursday and Friday our veterinarian visited and carried out a total of 15 animals and collected material for further research.<br>On Wednesday, the NVWA collected a cargo of birds that were examined in Lelystad on West Nile Virus. The negative result has now arrived.<br>On Thursday, the Dutch Wildlife Health Center also picked up a load of birds and we got a result today. Both veterinarians (ours and those from the DWHC) discussed their findings with each other. (Birds in good condition, some small bleeding in some animals, good for the upcoming winter, empty stomachs.) It is a very strange story!<br>Components of the deceased birds now go to various institutes for further research into rat poison and various viruses. On Monday the preparations are ready and the microscopic examination is started.<br>In the meantime, the municipality has instituted an outlet ban in the park until further notice.<br>We will keep you informed and hope that we will get a quick answer regarding the bizarre deaths.<br>Source 5: New contribution from Facebook:<br>Nov. 2, 2018<br>There is, of course, no certainty about the cause. There are stronger 4G and IoT channels in the vicinity near the park. In July there was also 5G tested, but then the birds did not swarm and they did not arrive in the park.<br>IoT has also been active since 30 October 2017, so it is only briefly active with a safe distance (for humans) of 7.4 meters and with a 2000 Watt transmitter at less than 200 meters from the park main beam direction exactly across the park. Also at the same distance LTE channels and at another location also LTE stations etc. Here again exactly about the park.<br>The truth about the safety of 5G is that it’s not safe. And while letters have been sent and people have raised the alarm, the “powers that be” don’t seem to care. All in the name of money and industry.<br><br>"}

Well, the company and far-left media didn’t say a word about this. They didn’t address the immunization status of the dead pilots. If people find out that experimental jabs kill healthy pilots, they will start panicking and ditch the jabs. Guess what… All the pilots had received their COVID-19 jab This modern video was posted on BitChute at the end of May, 2021. The claim that this obvious conspiracy theory video was made in 1930 is false. The unknown creator(s) of this video tried to make it difficult to find the possible sources for the video material. Video is of low quality and recorded from an angle. However, it is not difficult to establish that the video is actually modern propaganda. It could be also a modern parody, but I doubt that.<br><br>There are several issues:<br><br>Music. It is from Betty Boop in Snow-White, 1933: St. James Infirmary Blues performed by Cab Calloway. Paramount Pictures bought the rights for this music just like they would do with modern movies. This music was not used in any other movie made in USA probably before late 1980s because the copyright is valid for 50 years.<br>The term “weaponized influenza” is fairly new, it wasn’t used before late 1950s.<br><br>A whistleblower from another company made some shocking claims. The person works at JetBlue Airways, and claims that 5 pilots had died between February and May of 2021.<br><br>This is really awkward. Five people died within a few months.

{"id":47,"title":"Depopulation Through Forced Vaccination: The Zero Carbon Solution … Almost a Decade Later","date":"August 20, 2020","body":" On April 26th, 2009 the Irish Independent published an article titled ‘Concern for Children’s Health as Parents ignoring vaccines’. Edel Kennedy, you should be ashamed of yourself! This is nothing less than an attempt by government, through their puppets in the media, to remove the rights of parents to determine the life choices of their offspring and removes any doubt that we now live in a dictatorship.<br><br>This is an OUTRAGEOUS insult to every parent in the country who has the common sense to research the efficacy of vaccines themselves by simply looking at the historical record rather than trust politicians whose lies in the media, including those perpetrated by the Dept. of Health under Mary Harney regarding the farce of ‘ swine flu’ and the dangerous myth of HPV vaccination, have led the country into the abyss of utter poverty and sold the country into the communist grasp of European bureaucrats whose sole aim is the destruction of every member nation’s sovereignty leaving them clutching at the bailout begging bowl of the IMF.<br><br>Vaccines are a fraud; pure and simple!<br><br>The historical record PROVES this for anyone with a little patience and the courage to investigate the FACTS for themselves, and it does take courage, especially for those in the medical profession whose careers will be at risk if they dare expose this danger to our children. It also shatters their illusions that they’re part of an organization which is far from beneficial to those they believe they’ re protecting from illness. However, their Hippocratic Oath should compel them to investigate such wild claims put out by pharmaceutical giants and their drug dealer sales representatives instead of taking the word of an industry well known as being utterly corrupt and ruthless in its business practices.<br><br>The Irish hemophiliac scandal, where patients were knowingly infected with HIV through contaminated blood products should be enough to convince anyone of Big Pharma’s murderous intent. This brings us to the real reasons for vaccinations. I’m not even going to prove to readers that they don’t work. I’ll simply urge you to look up the historical record. One simple example is the demise of measles.<br><br>The measles death rate had declined by 98% from 1915-1958 prior to any vaccination being introduced.<br>In 1988 and 1989, 69% and 89% for measles cases in American school-aged children had been vaccinated.<br>In 1995, 56% of ALL measles cases in America were vaccinated.<br>These figures come from medical journals. Those 3 simple examples PROVE that unvaccinated children are less likely to contract measles and that the vaccine was useless. Look that up for yourself. All other vaccine claims that they’ve cured or eliminated disease follow a similar pattern. Better hygiene, clean water and good healthy food was the cause of the decline and any doctor worth his smelling salts should know that. If they don’t then they are misinformed on a grand scale or they’re in complete denial. Therein lies the problem. Why have doctors been ‘indoctrinated’ to believe that vaccines are the sacred cow of medicine when the historical record clearly shows that they are virtually useless?<br><br>Hold onto your sanity because I have some bad news for you.<br><br>The real reason for vaccinations, apart from the massive profits to the manufacturers, is to ensure that you get sick throughout your life, again not only to enrich these same corporations that made you sick, but to ensure that many, if not all of you, die before you ever receive your pension and when you are no longer any of use to society. That’s why they want you retiring later in life and are forcing you through economic terrorism to work longer regardless of your age or health. They literally want to work you to death. If you don’t work you will be classed as a burden to society, a financial cost which society has to bear, and therefore you will be stigmatized as a ‘useless eater’; a consumer of resources needed for the rest of society. When Big Pharma can no longer profit from the illness they gave you, you will be left to die.<br><br>This is the depopulation agenda promoted under the United Nations Division of Population under the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. We only need look at Africa, the nation which the United Nations has said themselves, could feed the world. Why then are millions in Africa starving to death on that continent? It’s meant to be that way folks.<br><br>All of us at one time or another have been led to believe in the efficacy of vaccines. I was one of them and had my child vaccinated nearly 35 years ago. I wouldn’t even dream of it now. I think it’s safe to say that we’re all aware of the real pandemic, as opposed to the fake pandemics of the past. It’s called ‘CANCER’. Autism is also at crisis (pandemic) levels all across the world where mass vaccination programs exist.<br><br>Prior to mass vaccination, cancers were extremely rare, as in almost nonexistent. Today in the western, so called developed world, we face a crisis of cancer to the extent that between one in five to one in two will suffer, many dying, from one form of cancer or another. What’s happened to cause this pandemic?<br><br>We only have to look back at the Jonas Salk polio vaccine that went around the world in the full knowledge that it contained the SV40 virus which had no other purpose than causing cancer; yet it was pushed as a vaccine for polio when, as with measles, polio was well in decline prior to any vaccine due to the same factors.<br><br>Enter stage right at the TED 201 0 conference, Mr. Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, the biggest computer firm on the planet. What has Bill Gates to do with vaccines you’ re wondering?<br><br>The globalist elite care nothing for humanity; ordinary men, women and children must be eliminated in their delusional minds to ensure that their superior types go into the future with the best of breeding being the only criteria worthy of saving. You and I are no longer required and that is why we are seeing the loss of our economy, our wealth, our health, our happiness and ultimately, OUR LIVES"}

{"id":49,"title":"Why Pimple Popping Videos Are So Strangely Satisfying","date":"November 11, 2019","body":"One of YouTube’s most enduring subcultures is a broad ecosystem of videos described by users and uploaders as ‘Strangely Satisfying.’ This is the haptic side of the site, a constellation of different videos that seek to activate the senses of pleasure-seeking audiences. There’s the ASMR (auto-sensory meridian response) video, which uses gentle sounds to generate a tickling sensation in the viewer. The slime video is a gelatin playground for disembodied hands and fingers. Industrial shredder and hydraulic press videos send iPhones, pineapples, and other unexpected objects through the aforementioned equipment. The ‘hot knife’ video sets a superheated blade to anything you can imagine. Mukbang is a Korean-born cousin of ASMR that swaps whispering for chewing. That’s to say nothing of the ‘chiropractic adjustment’ video, and numerous more that please, tingle, and relax those susceptible to their sway. The pimple popping video is one of the most popular variants of this phenomenon, perhaps because it centers on an act so many of us are familiar with, from adolescence through adulthood. But the most popular pimple popping videos — with colorful names like ‘Nasty Pimples Gone Wild,’ ‘Stomach Churning Cyst Is Popped On Mans Face,’  ‘Extreme Blackheads – Oiliest Skin You’ll Ever See,’ and ‘NASTIEST PIMPLE POP EVER!!!’ — are a little more intense than the blemishes we’re used to dealing with in the morning. They vary widely in visual quality, from low-fidelity phone footage of amateur dermatologists putting their unfortunate family members’ zits on display to well-lit recordings of professional medical procedures.<br><br>They’re filmed everywhere, from suburban kitchens in America to day spas in Vietnam, and probably viewed in as many places as well. Some of them feature cystic acne, which needs to be slit open before pressure is applied, while others showcase minefields of blackheads and ‘soft pops.’ Sometimes the pus comes out smooth, like icing from a pastry bag, while other times it doesn’t want to give. If you’re really lucky, a projectile might fly out and hit the camera, an organic reminder of the layers of glass and electronics between our eyes and what we see. The pimple popping community has received a certain amount of mainstream attention thanks to Dr. Sandra Lee, a dermatologist better known as ‘Dr. Pimple Popper,’ star of the TLC TV series of the same name. Contrary to her moniker, little of Dr. Lee’s show features pimples or popping. She only features the most severe epidermal abnormalities and invasive procedures, true to TLC’s exhibitionist programming prerogative. Unlike her YouTube videos, which show only the surface of the skin and are soundtracked by casual conversation between Lee and her patients, Dr. Pimple Popper spends a lot of time telling the often heart-wrenching life stories of Lee’s most unique clients.<br>"}

The plan suggests such harms could be publicised through an international 'world no alcohol day/week'.<br>It says: 'Appropriate attention should be given to prevention of the initiation of drinking among children and adolescents, prevention of drinking among pregnant women and women of childbearing age, and protection of people from pressures to drink.' <br><br>The UK's Chief Medical Officers say the 'safest approach' for women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant is not to drink alcohol at all.<br><br>However, Matt Lambert, of UK alcohol trade body the Portman Group, said it was 'extremely concerned, by the WHO's proposal. <br>He added: 'As well as being sexist and paternalistic, and potentially restricting the freedoms of most women, it goes well beyond their remit and is not rooted in science.'<br><br>The NHS website says experts are still unsure exactly how much - if any - alcohol is completely safe for pregnant women to drink.<br><br>But it warns drinking in pregnancy can lead to 'long-term harm to the baby', with higher intake presenting the greatest risk. <br><br>Dr Richard Piper, Chief Executive of Alcohol Change UK, said: 'Drinking alcohol in the early stages of pregnancy, even before many people realise they are pregnant, can be very damaging for a foetus.<br><br>'It's important that people understand these risks - but also vital that we balance this against each adult's right to make informed decisions about what we do with our bodies, no matter our age or sex.'<br>"}
