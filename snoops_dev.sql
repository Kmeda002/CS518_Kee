IDENTIFYING BRIDGES BETWEEN LANGUAGE BASED TWITTERSPHERES', '2020', '', 0, 'Global political developments – such as Brexit, climate change, or forced migration – are entangled with communication that transcends national publics. Meanwhile, the EU’s integrity suffers, also due to polarised online discourses, which are sometimes actively manipulated. Therefore, an overview of online communication beyond language barriers is essential. However, whether and how online media create a global space that sustains deliberation of national and global interests by citizens, remains understudied. We approach this problem by exploring relations between the Italian and German Twittersphere, while asking: 1) What is the macrostructure of this bilingual network? 2) Are there bridges between these language communities in the form of single accounts and how can they be described? 3) Are there bridges in the form of groups and what are they tweeting about? We build on an innovative network crawling strategy for language-based Twitter follow networks. We developed it further to combine strengths of rank degree, snowball, and forest fire sampling. Thereby, we collect a network sample of the most central accounts in the Italian-German Twittersphere. Preliminary results suggest a bridging quality of soccer and connections between political clusters of both languages by EU politicians. Furthermore, larger network clusters connect mainly with one linguistic domain while smaller communities show a bridging behaviour. The final paper will present results of months of data collection, focusing on the relation between topics discussed within clusters and their connectivity. While it focuses on the German-Italian Twittersphere, our methods open up new avenues of enquiry regarding multi-language public spheres.', 'F. Münch, L. Rossi'),

Social network analysis of 23 Twitter hashtags related to sexual assault shows minimal engagement with disclosive tweets, while interviews with survivors (N = 27) indicate that hashtagged disclosures can result in impactful interactions with other survivors, particularly via less visible social media channels, such as direct messages. In combination, results suggest (1) that survivor networks can and do form around mundane hashtags, and (2) that highly visible hashtagged disclosures act as beacons to other survivors and are employed in pursuit of motivations such as supporting other survivors and challenging stigma associated with sexual assault.', 'Kristen Barta'),

In this work, we enrich the representation of images in image tweets by considering their social context. We argue that in the microblog context, traditional image features, e.g., low-level SIFT or high-level detected objects, are far from adequate in interpreting the necessary semantics latent in image tweets. To bridge this gap, we move from the images\' pixels to their context and propose a context-aware image bf tweet modelling (CITING) framework to mine and fuse contextual text to model such social media images\' semantics. We start with tweet\'s intrinsic contexts, namely, 1) text within the image itself and 2) its accompanying text; and then we turn to the extrinsic contexts: 3) the external web page linked to by the tweet\'s embedded URL, and 4) the Web as a whole. These contexts can be leveraged to benefit many fundamental applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness our framework, we focus on the task of personalized image tweet recommendation, developing a feature-aware matrix factorization framework that encodes the contexts as a part of user interest modelling. Extensive experiments on a large Twitter dataset show that our proposed method significantly improves performance. Finally, to spur future studies, we have released both the code of our recommendation model and our image tweet dataset.', 'Tao Chen, Xiangnan He, Min-Yen Kan'),

Although vast amounts of data in such networks are due to breaking news or global occurrences, local events witnessed by users in situ are also present in these streams and of great importance for many city entities. Nowadays, unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as Tweet-SCAN, are able to retrospectively detect these local events from tweets. However, these approaches have limited abilities to reason about unseen observations in a principled way due to the lack of a proper probabilistic foundation. Probabilistic models have also been proposed for the task, but their event identification capabilities are far from those of Tweet-SCAN. In this paper, we identify two key factors which, when combined, boost the accuracy of such models. As a first key factor, we notice that the large amount of meaningless social data requires explicitly modeling non-event observations.Therefore, we propose to incorporate a background model that captures spatio-temporal fluctuations of non-event tweets. As a second key factor, we observe that the shortness of tweets hampers the application of traditional topic models. Thus, we integrate event detection and topic modeling, assigning topic proportions to events instead of assigning them to individual tweets. As a result, we propose Warble, a new probabilistic model and learning scheme for retrospective event detection that incorporates these two key factors. We evaluate Warble in a data set of tweets located in Barcelona during its festivities. The empirical results show that the model outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques in detecting various types of events while relying on a principled probabilistic framework that enables to reason under uncertainty.', 'Joan Capdevila, J.

The role that food plays is complex: it is a necessity of life, yet it also serves to enhance and impact our lives in many ways. The meal is more than an object; it is an event or lived experience where the senses meet with emotions and cognitive energies (Rozin, 1999). In the social domain, “food becomes a lens through which we may explore the stratified realities of a society, its ideas about worth, about class, sex/gender, race, religion, and even nationality and humanity” (Bonnekessen, 2009, p. 280). Food is often central to the understanding of culture; the ways in which it is caught, farmed, cleaned, processed, cooked and eaten are symbolic of different kinds of meaning at many different levels (Srivivas, 2007). As eating together is perhaps the most basic expression of human sociality, ethnic cuisine (and those whom provide it) could act as the bridge between a diversity we cherish and a common humanity that must be achieved if we are to live harmoniously in an-ever flattening world (Van Den Burghe, 1984). One aspect of food that is sweeping into the subconscious of popular culture in the United States is the reincarnation of street food. Street foods, broadly defined as ready-to-eat foods and beverages prepared and/or sold by vendors or hawkers (especially in the streets and other similar places), have become a provision for social experiences that symbolize multicultural harmony for many food enthusiasts (Miles, 2011). There is an inherently authentic aspect of street food that may be why it is attractive to consumers (Camarena, Sanjuan, & Philippidis, 2011). Globally, street food operations represent a significant part of urban food consumption for millions of low-and-middle-income consumers. Street food preparation and selling provides a regular source of income for millions of men and women with limited education or skills, especially because the activity requires low initial investment. This activity also supports local agricultural producers and food processors and contributes to local and national economic growth (Steptoe A. P., 1995). In the United States, chefs and food enthusiasts with similar backgrounds and reduced start-up costs can account for over 20,000 trucks, generating nearly $650 million dollars in sales (Sacks, 2011). One of the biggest challenges for food truck survival is creating awareness and interest via advertising, recognizing a severe lack of experience and resources compared to restaurant chains (Miller R. , 2012). This paper will build on previous research that suggests that successful web advertisements have a positive effect on purchase intentions (Hwang, Yoon, & Park, 2011), assuming the perceived benefits carry over to the food truck industry. Also, further investigation will be conducted to determine the most appropriate audience and advertisement style. The ultimate goal of this proposed research is to provide a plausible advertising strategy for small business owners who presumably do not have an extensive background in advertising. While food can act as a reinforcement of ethnic ties, it can also provide a passive yet enjoyable method of integration and inclusion of nonindigenous cultures. The continued success of street food in the United States could have implications far beyond a source of revenue, which is the underlying purpose of this paper. LITERATURE REVIEW: According to Acho-Chi, street food service points have become “empowering public sites for social networking where people relax, tell stories, brag, and discuss politics, sports and business ventures. As such, street food selling and consumption have become synonymous with expressions of sharing and conviviality” (Acho-Chi, 2002, p. 136). This positive determination of street food is shared by Romano who claims, “the deeper hunger that\'s driving the street-food trend—the desire to reach out and connect with a globalized world that we\'re more aware of and reliant on than ever—is worth celebrating” (Romano, 2011, p. 54). Street food in the United States allows us to indulge in cross-culture experimentation and socialization for a fraction of the cost one would pay at a standard sit-down restaurant. The barrier to continued success for street food in the United States does not appear to be an aversion to new cultures. Americans have often suspended traditional racial prejudices and opened themselves to a range of diverse culinary and cultural experiences (Barbas, 2003). The more relevant obstacle facing street food is expanding its customer base. This would include potential customers who are not proactive in the search of mobile food trucks, particularly for dining destinations with little visibility or brand awareness. The most difficult aspect of this endeavor is to produce effective advertising with a severely limited budget. Although it has been postulated that only a third of all advertising campaigns show an immediate and significant influence on sales for restaurant franchises (Herrington, 2010), advertising for restaurants continues to accrue billions of dollars annually. As the users of social networks grow past a billion, restaurants are using social media to obtain feedback on menu offerings, communicate with customers, and increase traffic via contests and giveaways. DiPietro et al. conducted a study to measure how chain restaurants use Facebook, Twitter, and FishBowl (DiPietro, Crews, Gustafson, & Strick, 2012). One of the interesting findings was that respondents cited people under the age of thirty-five to be the most appropriate age group to be reached via social media. A study conducted by Hyun et al. provided findings on evaluative advertising dimensions (Hyun, Kim, & Lee, 2011), suggesting that advertising that contained relevant news, entertainment factors, and a sense of familiarity positively influenced purchase behavior. According to Hwang et al. (2011), effective website design for casual-dining restaurants can contribute to building brands and future purchases, and if web visitors like the websites of particular restaurants, they are more likely to visit those restaurants. Previous research has also shown that significant others can be especially powerful elicitors of normative thoughts and behavior (Stapel, Joly, & Lindenberg, 2010). Furthermore, thinking of significant others is likely to activate the norms, attitudes, opinions, and behaviors they are associated with (Van Knippenberg, 1992). For these reasons, social media has in many ways replaced interaction and word-of-mouth advertising, and has thus become a very powerful advertising tool (Hennig-Thurau, Gwinner, Walsh, & Gremier, 2004). Social media has been studied extensively in terms of how it can be used for effective advertising for restaurants, particularly large restaurant chains (DiPietro, Crews, Gustafson, & Strick, 2012). However, research focused on utilizing social media for advertising street food trucks is currently lacking. METHODS: To determine the usage of social media as an advertising outlet, surveys (similar to Dipeitro’s model) will be administered randomly to street food truck purveyors in a twelve mile radius of Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas on random days of randomly chosen months. The location was chosen because of its established reputation for housing several street food trucks (Austin boasts over 1,000 food trucks for the 1.7+ million residents). An additional survey will be constructed and administered to measure advertising awareness and usage of street food trucks, as well as demographic information pertinent to the study. In addition, the content of any advertisement recalled will be recorded. This survey will incorporate validated measurement tools that have been previously discussed, particularly those by Hyun et al. and Hwang et al. The distribution of the survey will be random. One of the criteria for selection will be that the respondent live in a ten mile radius of a proximity recognized as having street food truck operations (operationalized with a dummy variable “Do you live within ten miles of a food truck”). Analyses will be conducted to determine (1) if street food vendors are currently utilizing social media for the purpose of advertising, (2) whether social media influences certain demographic groups like gender and age, and (3) if advertising via social media influences behavioral intentions to purchase street food. The resultant hypotheses are thus: H1: Advertising via social media is not currently utilized by the majority of street food vendors interviewed. H2: The importance of advertising via social media will be positively influenced by age of street food patrons. H3: Social media advertising positively influences street food patrons’ behavioral intentions. H4: Favorable social media advertising for current non-users of street food under the age of 35 will positively influence future purchases EXPECTED IMPLICATIONS: The majority of street food trucks vendors lack the extensive marketing backgrounds, as well as the capital to invest in traditional advertising outlets (Zukin, 1995). In addition, social media advertising is not currently utilized by the majority of street food vendors (Herrington, 2010). However, research indicates that social media is rapidly gaining popularity within the food industry as a cost efficient and positively influential advertising tool. Increasing the exposure of street food should increase the likelihood of increased usage of street food. This study will help determine the usage of social media as an advertising tool among street food purveyors. Establishing usage levels among street food purveyors will help determine if (1) street food purveyors are taking advantage of a powerful advertising tool and (2) m', 'Steve Migacz PhD Student, J.

Regarding in many occasions, multisourced texts share some common contents with respect to the same topics. For example, a tweet and a news report may talk about the same event. Therefore, our goal is to correlate such texts of different sources with respect to the similar topics and get integrated more comprehensive information to facilitate other data mining tasks as well as online applications. To handle the problem, we propose a heterogeneous information network-based text aligning (HINTA) framework in this paper. HINTA applies meta-paths to calculate the text similarities, and constructs correlated pairs between the two types of texts. Next, HINTA first applies anchored pairs as bridges to combine the different types of texts. Finally, three different inference methods are employed to align the multisourced texts.

Here, we evaluate the effect of the DST shift on a whole spectrum of diseases—an analysis we hope will be helpful in weighing the risks and benefits of DST shifts. Our study relied on a population-based, cross-sectional analysis of the IBM Watson Health MarketScan insurance claim dataset, which incorporates over 150 million unique patients in the US, and the Swedish national inpatient register, which incorporates more than nine million unique Swedes. For hundreds of sex- and age-specific diseases, we assessed effects of the DST shifts forward and backward by one hour in spring and autumn by comparing the observed and expected diagnosis rates after DST shift exposure. We found four prominent, elevated risk clusters, including cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks), injuries, mental and behavioral disorders, and immune-related diseases such as noninfective enteritis and colitis to be significantly associated with DST shifts in the United States and Sweden. While the majority of disease risk elevations are modest (a few percent), a considerable number of diseases exhibit an approximately ten percent relative risk increase. We estimate that each spring DST shift is associated with negative health effects–with 150,000 incidences in the US, and 880,000 globally. We also identify for the first time a collection of diseases with relative risks that appear to decrease immediately after the spring DST shift, enriched with infections and immune system-related maladies. These diseases’ decreasing relative risks might be driven by the documented boosting effect of a short-term stress (such as that experienced around the spring DST shift) on the immune system.', 'Hanxin Zhang, Torsten Dahlén, Rana Atif Ali Khan, G.

The same analyses were performed to examine effects of the return to standard time in the fall. We employed several falsification checks.ResultsThere were 2.9% fewer (95% CI: –4.2%, −1.6%, p < 0.0001) assaults immediately following DST, when we lose an hour, as compared to a week later. In contrast, there was a 2.8% rise in assaults immediately following the return to standard time, when an hour is gained, as compared to a week later (95% CI: 1.5%, 4.2%, p < 0.0001). Multiple falsification analyses suggest the spring findings to be robust, while the evidence to support the fall findings is weaker.ConclusionsThis study suggests that mild and short-term changes in sleep do significantly affect rates of assault. Specifically, there is support for the theory that mild sleepiness possibly associated with an hour loss of sleep results in reduced assaults. This contradicts the simple inverse relationship currently suggested by most of the correlational literature. This study and the mixed findings presented by experimental studies indicate that measurement variability of both sleep and aggression may result in conflicting findings.', 'Rebecca H Umbach, A.

The aim of this study is to explore the effects of transitions into and out of daylight saving time on the incidence of such injuries. Method This is a retrospective comparative observational study of 11-year of data submitted prospectively to the Trauma Audit Research Network (TARN) between 1996 and 2006. Data for 4 weeks before and after time transition in spring and autumn of each year was collected. The time periods selected reflect those hours with maximum light level changes due to time alterations (2-hour around sunrise and 4-hour around sunset). Travellers outside those hours are unlikely to be affected by the changes. Results Out of 178,954 incidents in England and Wales, TARN returned 1296 incidents meeting the above time criteria, of which 282 involved a fatality. Overall, there were more crashes in autumn (845, 65.2%) comparing to spring period (451, 34.8%), with the majority occurring around sunset (1057, 81.5%). RTC related injuries at the onset of DST in spring showed a significant increase up to 14 days post time change (P=0.029), with the majority of the increase occurring at sunset. The highest increases occurred within the fatal incidents group (P=0.0019) and affected mainly the pedestrian subgroup (P=0.013). Changes in the incidence of injuries around the change back to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in autumn did not reach significance. Conclusion The use of DST over the period studied was associated with rise in RTC related injury figures up to two weeks following the spring time transition. These findings inform the continuing clock changes debate. The introduction of 2-hour time change may result in detrimental effects on RTC related injuries.', 'J. Alsousou, D. Butler, Omar Bourma, F.

Effects are largest during the hour of sunset prior to DST (i.e., the hour which was in darkness before but, post-DST, is now light), suggesting changes are due to ambient light rather than other factors such as increased police presence, and we find no changes in crimes where ambient light is unlikely to be a factor. As an additional robustness check, we exploit the variation in the impact of DST by hour and crime to repeat our analysis in a triple-difference framework and show results are largely consistent. Using the social cost of crime, we estimate the 2007 spring extension of DST resulted in $558 million in avoided social costs of crime per year, suggesting investment in lighting such as street lights could have high returns. Finally, we consider if our findings are the result of increased criminal incapacitation or deterrence of criminal behavior, and provide suggestive evidence the majority of the effect is due to deterrence.', 'Jennifer L.

The key findings are: (1) The total electricity savings of Extended Daylight Saving Time were about 1.3 Tera Watt-hour (TWh). This corresponds to 0.5 percent per each day of Extended Daylight Saving Time, or 0.03 percent of electricity consumption over the year. In reference, the total 2007 electricitymore » consumption in the United States was 3,900 TWh. (2) In terms of national primary energy consumption, the electricity savings translate to a reduction of 17 Trillion Btu (TBtu) over the spring and fall Extended Daylight Saving Time periods, or roughly 0.02 percent of total U.S. energy consumption during 2007 of 101,000 TBtu. (3) During Extended Daylight Saving Time, electricity savings generally occurred over a three- to five-hour period in the evening with small increases in usage during the early-morning hours. On a daily percentage basis, electricity savings were slightly greater during the March (spring) extension of Extended Daylight Saving Time than the November (fall) extension. On a regional basis, some southern portions of the United States exhibited slightly smaller impacts of Extended Daylight Saving Time on energy savings compared to the northern regions, a result possibly due to a small, offsetting increase in household air conditioning usage.

A 20% decrease (increase) in crimes is found when the DST transition increases (decreases) the amount of sunlight by one hour during the 7-9 p.m. period. Importantly, no significant response is detected induced by DST associated with a plausible demand-side response such as the population’s commuting time pattern, and no substantial short-term displacement is found.

Methods This study uses crime data from the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) to measure the change in the odds that a crime results in an arrest when the amount of evening lighting changes. Using a logistic regression, this study compares the odds that a crime results in an arrest in the week after the transition to and from daylight saving time (DST) compared to the previous week. Several robustness checks are used. Results Following the transition to daylight saving time, when there is an extra hour of daylight during the evening, the odds of an arrest increase significantly for violent crime, and particularly for robbery. At the end of DST in the fall, when the evening has one hour less of daylight, there is no significant change in the odds of an arrest for any crime category. Conclusions These results suggest that the crime-reducing effect of lighting seen in past studies is caused, at least partially, by incapacitating offenders through arrest.', 'Jacob Kaplan'),

Promoting awareness and improving access to diagnostics is fundamental in addressing these missing cases. Diagnosis usually occurs in secondary care with data from our trust in 2017 revealing long wait times to undertake a sleep study and an average 2 clinic attendances before a diagnosis made. This places a considerable time and emotional burden on the patient and a financial and logistical burden on the hospital. Method To address these long wait-times, streamline the patient pathway and improve access to diagnostics, we piloted a monthly community outreach OSA clinic run from within a local General Practice (GP). The clinic received referrals directly from other neighbourhood GPs and issued patients with a portable diagnostic device to allow them to undertake a home sleep study. The clinic was supported by a ‘virtual MDT’ run by the hospital team where the results were reviewed and outcomes communicated directly to both patients and GPs. Pathway costs, waiting times and patient related experience measures were calculated and compared to the conventional hospital-based diagnostic pathway. Results The pilot ran from Jan 2018 to Feb 2019. 78 patients were referred and investigated along the outreach pathway with an average estimated cost per patient of £439.72 compared to £831.77 for the hospital-based diagnostic pathway. Table 1 provides a detailed cost breakdown and assumes the community clinic will be run by a band 6 health-care professional. When compared to the hospital pathway, data demonstrated a significant improvement in patient waiting referral to diagnosis made (37 days vs 239 days) and commence treatment (128 days vs 267 days) (all p<0.0001). Measures of patient satisfaction were significantly higher within the outreach clinic group compared to the hospital-based diagnostic group. Conclusion A hospital led community-based pathway can achieve cost-savings whilst resulting in more timely diagnosis of OSA within a local setting thereby widening access to diagnostics.

At a time when more energy efficient and passive solutions to the design of the built environment are paramount, it is becoming more essential to bridge the credibility gap between design targets and actual building performance, particularly during its post occupancy stage 1 . This study examines comfort conditions at Heelis, the Central Office Building for the National Trust in Swindon, Wiltshire. The research follows on after a series of reviews and studies that were conducted last year. Building visits, an occupant comfort survey and physical monitoring are used to obtain data on indoor air temperature, radiant temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, and daylight factors. In addition, the questionnaire survey is used to examine occupants\' comfort and satisfaction with their indoor environment in different zones of the building and the results are compared to data from the calculated dry resultant temperature. This study shows that for the monitored period during the summer of this year, overall conditions were satisfactory as proven by resultant temperatures between 20 and 24 C. Although no overheating occurred this year, the relationship between air and radiant temperatures is used to predict resultant temperature for 2006, an exceptionally hot summer. This has shown that although air temperatures do not exceed design benchmarks, resultant data shows some overheating on the first floor of the building where resultant exceeds 28 C for 3.4% of working hours. Daylight factors are also found to be up to 50% less than predicted values in some parts of the building. The monitoring and analysis has shown that although the building is performing rather well, some areas are in need of some improvement, emphasizing the importance of post occupancy evaluation in general in improving building performance and bridging the gap between design targets and performance data.', 'R.

The US Navy (in which I was then a commander), the Italian Navy and the US Marine Corps used exactly this approach successfully in Sicily, in April–May 1992, to slow and eventually redirect lava flow from Mount Etna that was threatening the small village of Zafferana. We came up with this plan while talking to an Italian geologist. He spoke no English and I spoke no Italian, but I have a bachelor\'s degree in geology and that helped a lot. We communicated on the back of a napkin while seated at a small restaurant at the ski lodge that became our base of operations. The navy units involved tried several different ways to place large decommissioned anti-terrorist barriers into a vent approximately 8,000 feet (2,440 metres) up the side of the volcano. The first plan was to drop individual barriers into the vent, but that failed because of insufficient quantity, and the heat simply ignited the concrete. We then built a very large slide and were going to stack barriers on the slide and slip it into the vent. The slide was constructed but was impossible to move to the vent as mountain winds forced it into the path of the aircraft. (I filmed it on video and it is rather dramatic.) Our third plan, which eventually worked, involved linking several dozen barriers together with asbestos-wrapped anchor chain and placing them in position around the vent. Additional concrete \'Dempster Dumpster\' pads were placed directly over the vent on a net formed of anchor chain. When the entire assembly was in place it was blown into the vent using plastic explosive. US Navy and US Marine Corps CH-53E helicopters were used to place the barriers and transport the Italian explosives ordinance team required to place the explosives. The lava tube carrying lava down the mountain to the vicinity of Zafferana collapsed when flow was interrupted. That removed the immediate danger. The long-term solution was to drive a bulldozer up the mountain, dig a very large canal and blow out the side of the vent. We had to change the engine on the bulldozer when we finally got it in place, …', 'M. Hulme');

Speakers are politicians, societal actors or journalists who are given voice in a news story. In claim analyses, a speaker directs, for instance, a thematic demand or decision towards another actor. In research on European identity, speakers address an EU frame in a news story. The variable “speaker” provides a broad categorization of the first or most important speaker in an article.

In newspapers, infographics are commonly used to show the weather, as well as maps and site plans for newsworthy events, and graphs for statistical data. As the printed newspaper approaches the 21st Century, the increased use of charts, maps and other graphic devices continues to affect both its appearance and means of telling the story. The recent design revolution, which has brought modular design, informational graphics and increased color, has made today\'s newspaper more attractive, more navigable and easier to comprehend than ever before (Utt and Pasternack 2000). About 90 percent of graphics editors in a 1993 study said that the primary role of graphics was to supplement textual material. At the same time, nearly all said informational graphics made the newspaper easier to understand and more attractive. 1991 the “Poynter Institute”, one of the most important center for training journalists in the United States, has conducted a study called Eyetrack that analyzes and records the way that readers see and navigate through the pages of newspaper, identifying entry points to the page and which elements attract attention and motivate them to read the text of the information. The results were very favorable for infography, the main findings of the research stated that 77% enter to the page visually because of the infographics, 61% because of the photography and 36% because of the headline. 87% of readers who see an infographic read the text and 41% read the text because of the headline. Infography is the genre that catches a reader on the page longer than others. Scientific studies as the one developed by the University of Lund (Sweden), presented in the new edition of Malofiej, showed that infography is the genre that catches readers on the page more time than the others. Because of its nature and its features, the infographics attract the curiosity of readers, who understand well the visual and extremely fragmented language Visual titles and infographics in the newsroom which have evolved as a result of the convergence of online and print news are Visual Editor, Visual Journalist, and Web Director depending on “which skills are used to manage visuals” (Zavoina and Reichert 2000). Components of Info graphics With the use of various components in combination, a well defined Infographics can be designed which can be simple to understand and influential to attract readers. Charts, flowcharts, diagrams, maps, mind maps, signs, typographic text are commonly used in designing infographics. Graphics can be defined as translations of numbers in the form of a drawing, design or plan to explain or illustrate something, Paul Lewi (2006). A chart is a graphical representation of data, in which the data is represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart. A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with arrows. This diagrammatic representation can give a stepby-step solution to a given problem. Histogram is a graphical representation, showing a visual impression of the distribution of data. A graphic (such as a chart or diagram) depicting the relationship between two or more variables used, for instance, in visualizing scientific data. A map is a visual representation of an area — Journal of Business Management & Social Sciences Research (JBM&SSR) ISSN No: 2319-5614 Volume 1, No.1, October 2012 _________________________________________________________________________________ 37 www.borjournals.com Blue Ocean Research Journals 37 a symbolic depiction highlighting relationships between elements of that space such as objects, regions, and themes. A diagram is a two-dimensional geometric symbolic representation of information according to some visualization technique. It is a graphical tool for organizing and representing knowledge. A topographic map is a detailed and accurate graphic representation of cultural and natural features on the ground. Contour lines are often given specific names beginning iso meaning \'equal\' according to the nature of the variable being mapped. Isotherm a type of contour line that connects points of equal temperature at a given date or time on a geographic map. Isobar is a line connecting points of equal atmospheric pressure. A mind map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks, or other items linked to and arranged around a central key word or idea. Signage systems are visually oriented information systems, consisting of signs, maps, arrows, color coding systems, pictograms and different typographic elements. Defined Levels of Info graphics Level#1: In this level, the elements used to design are mostly photographs along with statistical data (represented in tables) and or short information designed artistically to summarize the news or article. Figure 1 represents sample level#1 infographics. Level#2: Element of Level#1 with additional conceptual diagrams, visual representations like charts, maps, typography, symbolic interpretations etc. Figure 2 represents sample level#2 infographics. Level#3: Elements of Level#1 and Level#3 with wider approach of information design, detail conceptual thoughts represented with graphics and textual information and optimized use of visual components with well defined instructions techniques which help readers to understand and visualize the news or information.

The text was taken from Timor Express newspaper. The examination was to analyze its macrostructure, superstructure, microstructure and to describe the cognition and social context. We collected data by taking the news texts of Timor Express purposively. Additionally, we interviewed the editorial chief of the electronic mass media of the Timor Express to verify the data and to reach a deep understanding of the cognition and social contexts that implicitly realized in the news text construction. Results showed that the text structure of Kupang City fire extinguishing service in Timor Express news consists of macro-structure, super-structure, and microstructure. For the level of the superstructure, in general, Timor Express formulates headlines followed by leads consisting of script elements, which can be identified as: ‘what’, ‘when’, and ‘who’ elements. Meanwhile, elements ‘why’ and ‘how’ are in the news content (story). A macrostructure is a thematic form of the Kupang city fire extinguishing service news text. The microstructure consists of semantics, syntactic, stylistic, rhetoric. In the microstructure, the use of words that pointed to, or reinforced news messages about the fire disaster was investigated. In terms of social cognition, the aspect is realized in the form of journalists\' mental awareness of a fire disaster that received services from the Kupang City fire service department. Timor Express journalists considered that fire is an unpredictable humanitarian disaster which impacts material losses in life.', 'Ratna Katharina Lema'),

Could this headline cause a legal problem, or was its flaw cured by the accuracy of the news article under it? The former; in 1986, the state supreme court in Mississippi refused to permit dismissal of a libel complaint by the three. The court said “no ordinary reader would logically separate the headline from the text.”2 It added, “While a newspaper publishing company is granted some leeway in its reporting, they may not mistake the facts or otherwise misconstrue the truth.” 3 The Mississippi ruling was consistent with court approaches to headlines generally. Headlines can cause libel problems in themselves. Accuracy in headlines is a t least as important as accuracy in articles. Some judges, like the one in Mississippi. think newspaper readers will believe a false headline even when it is contradicted by a true news story; other judges take judicial notice that newspaper readers often read only the headlines.

Specifically, can the investing public trust the research analysis and recommendations they receive from Wall Street analysts? At issue is the independence and objectivity of sell-side analysts, a term applied to analysts that work for brokerage firms. Spring of 2001 brought media attacks on these analysts, with newspaper headlines such as The Financial Times’ “Shoot All the Analysts” and The Wall Street Journal’s “Outlook for Analysts: Skepticism and Blame”. Fortune even made analyst credibility a cover story with the title: “Can We Ever Trust Wall Street Again?” This paper attempts to address the question: What should we make of this brouhaha and what remedies are appropriate? It is quite clear that the major players, namely the brokerage firms, Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR), feel that something should be done and have already taken a number of actions. Several proposals have already been made through the trade association, the Securities Industry Association; and some individual brokerage firms have already unilaterally changed policies to stem the criticisms of ostensible conflicts of interest. Will the proposals offered by the brokerage industry fix what is broken? And perhaps more importantly, we should ask the important first question: What if anything is broken? We argue that at the heart of the credibility controversy are the disparate incentives of investment banks’ clients: while brokerage clients (“investors”) want unbiased research, most corporate financing clients (“issuers”) benefit from optimistic research. As corporate financing revenues dwarf brokerage commissions, investment banks face large incentives to maintain policies that favor issuers over investors. Furthermore, the managements of the corporations, the subjects of brokerage research, provide an additional incentive to analysts: issue positive research and maintain direct access to valuable future information or risk being shut out by management entirely. We conclude that while the fixes proposed and already undertaken may improve credibility, they are unlikely to be substantial remedies because they do not address the critical issue of these misaligned incentives. We also conclude that institutional investors, aware of analysts’ conflicts of interest, are able to de-bias the brokerage research they receive, and consequently maintain their own in-house research staffs and purchase independent research services. The disenfranchised are largely the individual investors, who lack the awareness or education necessary to adequately filter brokerage research recommendations. We begin our examination by providing background on the controversy. We next summarize the evidence from relevant academic work that demonstrates the value brokerage research can have for investors and the limitations of that value. We then discuss explanations for optimism biases that have been documented for brokerage earnings forecasts and recommendations, including incentives by and pressures from the analyst’s employer, from the companies the analyst reports about, and from institutional investors. Next, we analyze a number of proposals and actions that attempt to increase brokerage research objectivity and independence. Finally, we conclude by raising several issues that we believe are most critical to understanding the credibility controversy, and we cast doubt on the success of recently proposed fixes.', 'Leslie Boni, Leslie Kent Womack'),

The proboscis can be extended to be ten times longer than the original cell length quickly and repeatedly. The aim of this research is focused on its mechanism. In the previous researches, it is thought that the extension is elicited by the movement of the oral cilia and sliding in the microtubule bundles located under the cell membrane including the undercoat structure called “pellicle”. However, molecules concerned with such motility have been unknown. Accordingly, at first, we analyzed contribution to the extension and contraction of the movement of oral cilia by using a high-speed camera. And also, we observed the movement of the oral part and proboscis separated from the body of Lacrymaria olor. From these observations, it is concluded that the oral part highly contributes to the directional changes and extension power of the proboscis. Moreover, we stained the microtubules with fluorescence antibody and observed them by a confocal microscope. And I observed the ultrathin section of Lacrymaria olor by an electron microscope to see the microtubules located. From these observations, it is revealed that the microtubules are oriented in a spiral mode on the whole body of Lacrymaria olor. But, in spite of total coverage of microtubules on the body, the proboscis can move freely. It may indicate that the microtubules may also move or change the shapes to make the movement of the proboscis possible.', 'Delehouze, Rebillat'),

From comparative analyses of the enhanced \'Gismonda\' images it is revealed that the little collage is considerably more detailed and compete than the Mucha \'original\'. Thus, it is concluded that the poster is a hasty photographic plagiarism of the intricate collage. Further image processing of the scratches on the handle of the walking stick and the collage reveal them to conform to the famous and enigmatic \'P GO\' monogram signature of the artist Paul Gauguin. Thus, it follows that the original design was created by Gauguin rather than by Mucha. It may be that while Gauguin was in Brittany recovering from injuries sustained in a brawl his former lover, Annah la Javanese, pilfered his belongings and took them with her to Paris and her next lover, photographer-designer, Alphonse Mucha, who copied the collage and offered it as the Gismonda Poster.', 'J.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the attributes of a poster that improved the chance that nursing conference attendees would read it. Methods: A mixed-methods descriptive study employing survey methodology was used to assess the perceptions of nurses attending poster sessions at a two-day nursing conference. The survey consisted of basic demographic questions, 25 items asking respondents to identify and rate the importance of variables that influenced their decision to read a poster, and several open-ended questions. Both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the responses was performed. Results: The two major themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis were that poster-viewing decisions were based first on aesthetics and then on relevance. The quantitative analysis identified aesthetic characteristics that were most important to nurse viewers, including overall visual appeal, color, organization, and layout; viewers determined the relevance of a poster primarily by reading its title. Conclusions: To develop a poster that will attract an audience, nurse researchers should keep in mind the attributes that are important to their peers and colleagues.

In this report, we used a live attenuated Yersinia pestis vaccine to examine the impact of analgesic administration on the immune response elicited by a single dose of a live bacterial vaccine in mice. Mice were assessed by evaluating natural and provoked behavior, as well as food and water consumption. The resulting immune responses were assessed by determining antibody titers against multiple antigens and assaying cellular responses in stimulated splenocytes collected from vaccinated animals.

A cross-sectional survey was mailed to a random, weighted sample of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Fellows living in the United States in March 2019. Providers were asked about their attitudes toward package inserts, and to evaluate sample package insert statements following two different labeling rules.

This has brought hope to millions of Americans in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic. The FDA EUA guidance for both vaccines is to not administer the vaccine to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) additionally advises individuals with a history of an immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable or any history of anaphylaxis be observed for 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. All other individuals should be observed for 15 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. Staff at vaccine clinics must be able to identify and manage anaphylaxis. Post–FDA EUA, despite very strong safety signals in both phase 3 trials, reports of possible allergic reactions have raised public concern. To provide reassurance and support during widespread global vaccination, allergists must offer clear guidance to individuals based on the best information available, but also in accordance with the broader recommendations of regulatory agencies. This review summarizes vaccine allergy epidemiology and proposes drug and vaccine allergy expert opinion informed risk stratification for Allergy specialist use in conjunction with guidance of public health and regulatory authorities.

However, to our knowledge no population-based study has assessed the association between the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and Bell\'s palsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of Bell\'s palsy after BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccination.\n \n Methods\n In this case series and nested case-control study done in Hong Kong, we assessed the risk of Bell\'s palsy within 42 days following vaccination with BNT162b2 (Fosun–BioNTech [equivalent to Pfizer–BioNTech]) or CoronaVac (from Sinovac Biotech, Hong Kong) using data from voluntary surveillance reporting with the Hospital Authority, the COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Event Online Reporting system for all health-care professionals, and the Hospital Authority\'s territory-wide electronic health records from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. We described reported cases of Bell\'s palsy among vaccine recipients (aged 18–110 years for CoronaVac and aged 16–110 years for BNT162b2). We compared the estimated age-standardised incidence of clinically confirmed cases among individuals who had received the CoronaVac or BNT162b2 vaccination (up to 42 days before presentation) with the background incidence in the population. A nested case-control study was also done using conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for risk of Bell\'s palsy and vaccination. Cases and controls were matched (1:4) by age, sex, admission setting, and admission date.\n \n Findings\n Between February 23 and May 4, 2021, 451 939 individuals received the first dose of CoronaVac and 537 205 individuals received the first dose of BNT162b2. 28 clinically confirmed cases of Bell\'s palsy were reported following CoronaVac and 16 cases were reported following BNT162b2. The age-standardised incidence of clinically confirmed Bell\'s palsy was 66·9 cases per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 37·2 to 96·6) following CoronaVac vaccination and 42·8 per 100 000 person-years (19·4 to 66·1) for BNT162b2 vaccination. The age-standardised difference for the incidence compared with the background population was 41·5 (95% CI 11·7 to 71·4) for CoronaVac and 17·0 (−6·6 to 40·6) for BNT162b2, equivalent to an additional 4·8 cases per 100 000 people vaccinated for CoronaVac and 2·0 cases per 100 000 people vaccinated for BNT162b2. In the nested case-control analysis, 298 cases were matched to 1181 controls, and the adjusted ORs were 2·385 (95% CI 1·415 to 4·022) for CoronaVac and 1·755 (0·886 to 3·477) for BNT162b2.\n \n Interpretation\n Our findings suggest an overall increased risk of Bell\'s palsy after CoronaVac vaccination. However, the beneficial and protective effects of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risk of this generally self-limiting adverse event.

Moreover, as the engine operates in a supersonic range, an important secondary objective is to manage the shock wave location in the intake for maximum pressure recovery with adequate safety margin by varying the throat area of the nozzle simultaneously. To estimate the states and parameters as well as to filter out the process and sensor noises, a UKF has been incorporated for robust output feedback control computation. Furthermore, independent control designs for the actuators have been carried out to assure satisfactory performance of the engine.

The jets issue from conical CD nozzles closely placed side-by-side resembling the twin nozzle configuration of supersonic aircrafts. The results are relevant to scenarios where turbulent jet mixing, supersonic core length, thermal radiation and acoustic loading are of concern. Experiments show that closely spaced twin jets grow, merge and interact near the inter-nozzle region that influences the characteristic decay and jet spread. Moreover, the deviation in centerline characteristic decay is more significant at off-design conditions. Vortex generators in the form of small metallic rectangular tabs mounted at the nozzle exit plane in different azimuthal orientations are used to control the mixing characteristics and the spread of these jets. Abrupt reduction in the core length and suppression of shock cell structure is achieved in over to under-expanded conditions. Furthermore, the orientation of vortex generators is found to significantly influence the development of jet flow field. The jet bifurcation and formation of daughter streams with distorted quasi-periodic shock cells structure are visualized using the schlieren technique. The underlying mechanisms for the observed effects and the behavior of daughter streams are discussed.', 'Aqib Khan, Saif Akram, Rakesh Kumar'),

This beam-scanning technique relies on a patch antenna element that can be microfluidically repositioned at the focal plane of a microwave lens. The feed network is strategically designed to be passive and accommodate the position variation in the antenna element. This paper, for the first time, considers the design details and performance evaluation of three different passive network layouts that can potentially be utilized to excite MFPAs. Specifically, resonant corporate, resonant straight, and nonresonant straight microstrip line feed networks are introduced and their loss/bandwidth performances are investigated using the transmission line theory. In addition, a method of moments and ray tracing-based hybrid analysis is utilized to demonstrate the impact of the proposed feed networks on the radiation properties of the MFPA in terms of realized gain and side lobe levels (SLLs). It is shown that the resonant and nonresonant straight microstrip line feed networks reduce the SLL by more than 10 dB relative to the resonant corporate feed network utilized in the prior work. The performance improvements are experimentally verified through an eight-element extended hemispherical dielectric lens-based MFPA prototype. Different than the recent work that relied on liquid metal, the antenna element of this MFPA is implemented from a metalized plate by carrying out flow characterizations on various microfluidic channel geometries. This metalized plate approach paves the way for reliable liquid-metal-free microfluidic reconfigurable devices with higher efficiency and power-handling capabilities.', 'A. Gheethan, A. Dey, G.

In this paper, we investigate a link between preeclampsia and subsequent autism in the child, and we hypothesize that both conditions can be attributed to a severe depletion of cholesterol sulfate. Through studies on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, we demonstrate a strong statistical relationship among the signs and symptoms associated with autism and those associated with preeclampsia, pernicious anemia, and serious adverse reactions to vaccines. We show that VAERS reports associated with symptoms typical of pernicious anemia produce both a set of symptoms that are highly correlated with preeclampsia and another set highly correlated with autism. We explain this observation via an argument that, in a severe reaction, the cascade of events subsequent to vaccination reflects a profuse production of nitric oxide (NO) and consequential destruction of both red blood cells (RBCs) and cobalamin. This may explain the diverse signs and symptoms associated with both preeclampsia and severe vaccine adverse reactions. We argue that excess NO synthesis, induced by the aluminum and antigen in vaccines, results in hemolysis of RBCs, which allows hemoglobin to scavenge the excess NO, converting it to nitrate. The NO is also scavenged by cobalamin, leading to its inactivation and contributing to subsequent pernicious anemia.

This is a particularly important question for older people who are at increased clinical risk following infection and in whom immune senescence may limit vaccine responses. The BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 adenovirus vaccines were the first two vaccines deployed in the UK programme using an 8–12 week ‘extended interval’. Objectives We undertook analysis of the spike-specific antibody and cellular immune response in 131 participants aged 80+ years after the second dose of ‘extended interval’ dual vaccination with either BNT162b2 mRNA ( n  = 54) or ChAdOx1 ( n  = 77) adenovirus vaccine. Blood samples were taken 2–3 weeks after second vaccine and were paired with samples taken at 5-weeks after first vaccine which have been reported previously. Antibody responses were measured using the Elecsys® electrochemiluminescence immunoassay assay and cellular responses were assessed by IFN-γ ELISpot. Results Antibody responses against spike protein became detectable in all donors following dual vaccination with either vaccine. 4 donors had evidence of previous natural infection which is known to boost vaccine responses. Within the 53 infection-naïve donors the median antibody titre was 4030 U/ml (IQR 1892–8530) following BNT162b2 dual vaccination and 1405 (IQR 469.5–2543) in the 74 patients after the ChAdOx1 vaccine (p = < 0.0001). Spike-specific T cell responses were observed in 30% and 49% of mRNA and ChAdOx1 recipients respectively and median responses were 1.4-times higher in ChAdOx1 vaccinees at 14 vs 20 spots/million respectively ( p  = 0.022). Conclusion Dual vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 induces strong humoral immunity in older people following an extended interval protocol. Antibody responses are 2.9-times higher following the mRNA regimen whilst cellular responses are 1.4-times higher with the adenovirus-based vaccine. Differential patterns of immunogenicity are therefore elicited from the two vaccine platforms.

Post-second dose all subjects, regardless of the study group, were seropositive to 9 HPV types included in 9vHPV. Anti-HPV16 and 18 GMTs were higher in subjects with the mixed schedule and for the other 7 HPV types higher in subjects who received two doses of 9vHPV vaccine.

This protection is extended to their infants during the first months of life, as pathogen-specific antibodies formed in response to maternal vaccination are transferred across the placenta to the fetus. Notably, Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis) vaccination booster is routinely administered to pregnant women both to prevent neonatal tetanus and to ensure that infants have protective levels of pertussis antibodies until they are able to establish their own vaccine-induced levels. Whether infant protection through maternal immunization is merely due to an increase in maternal antibody levels or whether maternal immunization enhances the transfer of vaccine-specific antibodies is unclear. Moreover, the potential impact of prenatal vaccinations on the transplacental transfer of other antibodies, such as antibodies raised as a result of infections or other vaccines administered prior to pregnancy, has not been studied. The goal of this study was to define the impact of maternal vaccination on IgG transplacental transfer efficiency. We analyzed antigen-specific antibody populations and IgG subclass distribution in maternal and cord blood samples from 58 mother-infant pairs. All women received the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and 25 women received the Tdap vaccine during the second or third trimester of gestation. Prenatal Tdap vaccination did not impact the efficiency of IgG transplacental transfer; however, it was associated with higher maternal and infant vaccine-elicited Tdap-specific antibody levels, and with a higher proportion of infants with protective levels of antibodies, especially against diphtheria. There was also no difference in the IgG transplacental transfer rate of antibodies against non-Tdap vaccines between the two groups of women. Our results confirm previous reports demonstrating the benefits of prenatal Tdap immunization and indicate that this strategy does not impede the transplacental transfer of other antibodies that are also important for infant protection.', 'A.

An experimental vaccine adjuvanted with alum and composed by four recombinant salivary antigens mined with reverse vaccinology from a transcriptome of salivary glands from Rhipicephalus microplus ticks was previously shown to present an overall efficacy of 73.2% and cause a significant decrease of tick loads in artificially tick-infested, immunized heifers; this decrease was accompanied by increased levels of antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies, which were boosted during a challenge infestation. In order to gain insights into the systemic effects induced by the vaccine and by the tick challenge we now report the gene expression profile of these hosts’ whole-blood leukocytes with RNA-seq followed by functional analyses. These analyses show that vaccination induced unique responses to infestations; genes upregulated in the comparisons were enriched for processes associated with chemotaxis, cell adhesion, T-cell responses and wound repair. Blood transcriptional modules were enriched for activation of dendritic cells, cell cycle, phosphatidylinositol signaling, and platelets. Together, the results indicate that by neutralizing the tick’s salivary mediators of parasitism with vaccine-induced antibodies, the bovine host is able to mount normal homeostatic responses that hinder tick attachment and haematophagy and that the tick otherwise suppresses with its saliva.Tick vaccines: multivalent formulation activates leukocytes systemicallyAvailable vaccines to protect against the bovine tick Rhipicephalus microplus have variable efficacy, but a new experimental vaccine formulation featuring four R. microplus saliva antigens has shown enhanced protection against tick infestation by triggering the production of antigen-specific IgG antibodies in vaccinated bovines. Now, Isabel de Miranda-Santos and colleagues performed RNA sequencing analysis of peripheral blood immune cells from vaccinated calves and show that this multivalent vaccine induces systemic activation of leukocytes that prevents effective attachment of R. microplus ticks. The researchers report an increase in the expression of genes associated with chemotaxis, cell adhesion, T-cell responses and wound repair, and find evidence of enhanced activation of dendritic cells and platelets. The genes and biological pathways identified underline the importance of using vaccines to neutralize tick saliva, freeing systemic immune responses and skin immunity to prevent tick infestation in farm animals.', 'S.

However, little work has been done on the psychometric properties of the MCMI–III, using non-Western psychiatric samples. Outpatients (N = 212) completed the MCMI–III during a semi-structured interview. Eight exploratory factor analysis (EFA) methods were used to explore the underlying structure of MCMI–III.

The old neighborhoods were under siege from urban renewal/7 highway construction, and changing population patterns, but when I first arrived they were still here. Halsted Street was still the heart of the West Side colony, lined with fruittistendi, grosserie, and stori.2 Hull House was still a functioning institution, not a museum. As my research stretched over several years, I witnessed the destruction of that neighborhood. Images remain etched in my memory. A vast desolate area (like the bombed-out cities of wartime Europe) where houses and stores had been bulldozed; finally the only building standing was the Italian Church of the Guardian Angel (la Chiesa dell Angelo Custode). One day, as I watched from a distance, a procession emerged from the church and paraded through the empty streets with the statue of the patron saint?a Felliniesque vision. On the Near North Side was Little Sicily (also called Little Hell) where Father Luigi Giambastiani had presided over the parish of St. Philip Benizi for fifty years. Though the church still stood, the houses of his parishioners had been levelled to make way for public housing. Padre Luigi was a bitter man, his parishioners scattered and his church soon to be destroyed; many Italians I spoke with during those years were bitter. Their lives were literally reduced to heaps of rubble. I tell you this not to indulge in nostalgia about life in the old neighborhoods, but to remind us that the death of the Little Italies in the 1950s (a subject which deserves a book and a film), not only in', 'R.

These vaccines are likely our most powerful intervention to stem the tide of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. However, it will take time, political will, and widespread public support to achieve vaccination rates high enough to control the pandemic. As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issues emergency use authorizations for vaccines, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is issuing recommendations about who should receive the vaccine and their priority for receipt (1). It is important to recognize where pregnant persons fit into this national framework. Health care workers, of whom as many as 300000 may be pregnant, are in the highest-priority tier for vaccination and are currently being vaccinated. The next wave of vaccinations will be offered to persons with medical conditions, many of whommay also be pregnant. Following the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine and the Moderna mRNA1273 vaccine, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists offer the following recommendations. Pregnant persons should be offered the vaccine and should be encouraged to talk with their obstetric provider about their vaccination plan, although this is not a requirement for vaccination. Lactating persons should be encouraged to receive the vaccine. Persons planning to become pregnant should be encouraged to complete their vaccination series before conception to ensure that they are protected before pregnancy. Here, we discuss the rationale supporting these recommendations. To appreciate why pregnant women are included in these early vaccination efforts, it is important to understand the interplay between pregnancy and COVID-19. Recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant persons is associated with increased risk for intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death (2). Although the relative risks in pregnancy are increased, the absolute risks for severe disease are low, with about 1% of pregnant women in the United States requiring admission to an intensive care unit and 1.5 deaths per 1000 pregnant women with COVID-19 (2). Pregnant women with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, may have excess risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes (3). Further, the same racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes seen in the general population are observed in the pregnant population (4). Some, but not all, studies have observed an association between COVID-19 and risk for preterm births and cesarean deliveries (5). Taken together, the evidence suggests that pregnant women with COVID-19 have higher risk than similar nonpregnant persons for poor health outcomes and that risks may also be higher for their babies. Thus, it is critical that pregnant persons have the opportunity to be vaccinated if they would otherwise meet the criteria for vaccination. However, because pregnant women were excluded from COVID-19 vaccination trials, we have limited information about effectiveness and safety in this group. That said, we do have some data to help inform discussion with pregnant persons. First, these vaccines contain mRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle that is delivered into host cells. The body\'s own host cells generate coronavirus spike proteins that stimulate antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This activity occurs robustly in regional lymph nodes (6). There is no biological reason to suspect that this process is different during pregnancy, so we expect similar efficacy in pregnant and nonpregnant persons. Second, these vaccines contain no live virus or adjuvants that could affect the developing fetus. Further, available data about developmental and reproductive toxicity generated from rats administered the Moderna mRNA vaccine show no safety signals concerning female reproduction, fetal or embryonal development, or postnatal development (7). Finally, although COVID-19 vaccination has been associated with fever usually lasting less than 2 days, acetaminophen is acceptable treatment of fever in pregnancy, and vaccine-associated fever is no exception. Still, concerns will linger until human pregnancy data are available. Pregnancy-specific trials will provide data to address not only safety concerns, such as vaccine-associated miscarriage or fetal anomalies, but also vaccine efficacy for mother and possibly newborn through passively transferred antibodies. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that clinicians discuss with pregnant persons COVID-19 pregnancy risks, personal factors aside from pregnancy that may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection risk or disease severity, and benefits of and unknowns about vaccination. Information for providers to use when counseling, as well as patient information, has been developed (8). The use of vaccines to protect pregnant persons and their newborns from infectious diseases is an integral part of routine obstetric practice. Seasonal influenza vaccine protects mothers from severe illness while protecting neonates in the first several months of life. The tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine is given in each pregnancy between 26 and 34 weeks\' gestation to protect mother and baby from pertussis. These vaccines provide the best protection against known devastating effects of these viruses and have excellent safety profiles established using animal data and epidemiologic studies in pregnant women (9, 10). In the case of COVID-19, time is of the essence. Preventing ongoing severe illness due to COVID-19 for reproductive-aged women, including those who are pregnant or postpartum, necessitates', 'L.

No significant differences in growth parameters and developmental milestones were observed. No excess nor particular pattern of congenital defects/malformations were observed. In both groups, vaccinations were performed according to the national schedule (no live vaccines in the first year of life) without relevant complications (Figure 1). Conclusion TNFi may be required in patients that experienced flare during pregnancy and they are effective in controlling maternal disease and ensures a good pregnancy outcome without complications for the health and growth of exposed children.

Five possible sites of N-linked glyscoylation were identified. Although no nucleic acid homology existed between the IHNV glycoprotein gene and the glycoprotein genes of rabies and VSV, there was signicant homology at the amino acid level between all three rhabdovirus glycoproteins. EXPRESSION IN E.COLI OF cDNA FRAGMENTS ENCODING IHNV GLYCOPROTEIN GENE Abstract Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) ,a rhabdovirus, causes a fatal disease in salmonid fish. This agent is endemic to the Pacific Northwest and has endangered and trout industry there. the salmon enhancement programs The development of a safe, easily produced and economical vaccine has been widely sought by the industry. Since the virus is transmissible by water and endemic among wild populations of fish, attenuated or killed vaccines were unsuitable and the development of a subunit vaccine produced by recombinant DNA techniques was sought. In an effort to develop a subunit vaccine, cDNA clones to each IHN viral mRNA species were made and a physical map of the viral genome was constructed (Kurath and Leong, 1985; Kurath et al., 1985). The virion glycoprotein, G, was identified as the antigen responsible for inducing protective immunity, (Engelking and Leong, in preparation) and a cDNA clone encoding the entire (Feyereisen-Koener glycoprotein gene was isolated et al., in preparation). This gene was digested with the restriction endonuclease, Sau3A, and shotgun-cloned into PATH expression vectors (Tanese, Roth, and Goff, 1985) to produce trpE-G fusion proteins in E. coli. This report describes the trpE-G gene fusions that resulted in the production of a protein detected with antisera to the IHNV glycoprotein. It also presents preliminary data demonstrating the development of protective immunity to IHNV after expsoure to the fusion protein. INTRODUCTION Infectious hematopo1etic necrosis virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovlrus that infects salmon and trout. It produces an acute disease resulting from the destruction of the hematopoietic tissue in the kidneys and may lead to the loss of an entire fish hatchery population (Pilcher and Fryer, 1980). At the present time the only effective means for controlling this disease is the complete destruction of stocks of infected fish and sterilization of hatchery. These control methods are expensive and in some cases lead to the destruction of valuable fish stocks. Thus, an effort was made to develop a vaccine for IHNV. Previous studies have Indicated that protective immunity to IHNV was Induced in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka, Walbaum) with a strain of IHNV which had been passed on steelhead trout cells in tissue culture for more than 40 tfmes (Tebbit, 1976; Fryer et al., 1976). However, the attenuated strain was not effective as a vaccine in rainbow trout and was actually lethal in young trout (Winton , personal communication). In order to avoid some of the problems attendent with attenuated vaccines the development of a subunit vaccine to IHNV was undertaken. One of the first considerations in such an undertaking was the identification of the viral protein responsible for the induction of protective Immunity in fish. For the rhabdoviruses, vesicular stomatitis (VSV) and rabies, the viral glycoprotein is the only viral antigen which induces neutralizing antibody and protective immunity. We have shown that IHNV glycoprotein is a similar viral antigen (Annual Report, 1984). In the fish system where the immune response is less clearly understood, it was necessary that the IHNV glycoprotein be tested for its immunogenic properties. We report here that purified IHNV glycoprotein from Type 1 IHNV will induce protective immunity in salmonid fry to four other biochemical types of IHNV (Hsu, Engelking, and Leong, in press). Immune induction occurs after intraperitoneal inoculation or immersion in a solution of purified glycoprotein from Type 1 IHNV and protective immunity is produced in fish as small as 0.5 g and lasts for at least 30 days. It is critical in the development of a subunit vaccine to select a viral antigen that will induce immunity to all variants of a pathogen existing in the environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and virus The chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) embryo cells, CHSE-214, were obtained from J. L. Fryer, Oregon State University, Corvalli.s, Oregon and from the epithelioma papillosum cyprini cells (EPC) were obtained from D. Mulcahy, National Fisheries Research Center, Seattle, Washington. The cells were grown in Eagle\'s minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with fetal calf serum (5%), NaHC03 (0.075%), penicillin (100 i.u./ml) and streptomycin (100 ug/ml). The CHSE-214 cells were used to prepared virus stocks and the EPC cells were used for virus assays. Assays were performed using confluent EPC cell monolayers grown in 96well tissue culture plates (Falcon). Samples from infected fish were prepared as described (Engelking and Leong, 1981), sterilized by filtration (0.2 um acrodisc, Gelman), and diluted in MEM (without fetal calf serum). Duplicate samples (0.05-0.1 ml) of each dilution were placed on monolayers in individual wells and allowed to adsorb for 60 minutes. Sample Lnoculum was removed from the wells after adsorption and l-l.5 ml of MEM growth medium was added to each well. The Round Butte Type 1 and the Elk River Type 3 strains of IHNV were obtained from W. Groberg, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The', 'J. Leong'),

This dysfunction includes a shift from a type-1 to a type-2 T-cell cytokine response and enhanced T-regulatory (Treg) cell expression. Given the antitumor activity of select tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib in metastatic RCC (mRCC) patients, it is relevant to assess their effect on the immune system. Experimental Design: Type-1 (IFNg) and type-2 (interleukin-4) responses were assessed in Tcells at baseline and day 28 of treatment with sunitinib (50 mg/d) by measuring intracellular cytokines after in vitro stimulationwith anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies. Results:After one cycle of treatment, therewas a significant increase in the percentage of IFNgproducingTcells (CD3,P < 0.001; CD3CD4,P =0.001), a reduction in interleukin-4 production (CD3 cells,P = 0.05), and a diminished type-2 bias (P = 0.005).The increase in type-1response may be partly related to modulation of Treg cells. The increased percentage ofTreg cells noted in mRCC patients over healthy donors (P = 0.001) was reduced after treatment, although not reaching statistical significance.There was, however, an inverse correlation between the increase in type-1response after two cycles of treatment and a decrease in the percentage ofTreg cells (r = -0.64,P =0.01). Invitro studies suggest that the effects of sunitinib onTreg cells are indirect. Conclusions: The demonstration that sunitinib improved type-1T-cell cytokine response in mRCC patients while reducingTreg function provides a basis for the rational combination of sunitinib and immunotherapy inmRCC. Immune dysfunction has been well documented in cancer patients, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC; refs. 1–4). In RCC patients, there is a shift from a type-1–mediated CD4 T-cell response producing IFNg, which is critical for the development of effective antitumor immunity, to a type-2 cytokine response [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-10] that typically mediates humoral immunity (5, 6). Indeed, tumorspecific T-cell responses to the tumor-associated antigens MAGE-6 and EphA2 were characterized by a predominance of T cells that synthesize IL-5 and IL-4, with reduced levels or a complete absence of T lymphocytes expressing IFNg (7, 8). Patients rendered disease-free by primary tumor excision and/ or immunotherapy revert to a predominance of IFNg-producing type-1 CD4 T cells, suggesting that the tumor environment may be skewing the response to type-2 response (7). The diminished type-1 response in RCC patients is not limited to MAGE-6–specific and EphA2-specific CD4 T cells. Following polyclonal activation, Onishi et al. (9) showed that the peripheral blood lymphocyte response changes from predominantly type 1 to type 2 with advancing stage of RCC. There is growing evidence that CD4CD25 T-regulatory cells (Treg) may play an important role in suppressing the development of antitumor immunity in cancer patients (10). The frequency of Treg cells is elevated in tumor sites and/or the peripheral blood of patients with advanced tumors (11–15). Treg cells can impair induction of both antigen-specific and nonspecific T cells in melanoma patients (16, 17) and predict reduced survival in multiple cancer cell types (13, 18–20). Relevant to therapy, experimental models have shown that removal of Treg cells modifies the immune response to tumors. Depletion of Treg cells in mouse models with anti-CD25 antibody has been shown to enhance antitumor activity (10, 21–23). Furthermore, reducing peripheral blood Treg cell numbers in RCC patients using the recombinant IL-2 diphtheria toxin conjugate DAB389IL-2 enhanced the immunostimulatory activity of tumor RNA-transfected dendritic cell vaccines (24). Given the type-2 bias that develops in RCC patients and impairs antitumor immunity, it is relevant to generate strategies to promote a type-1 immune response (25, 26). To this end, we have examined the effect that treatment with the smallmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, would have on CancerTherapy: Clinical Authors’Affiliations: Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Department of Solid Tumor Oncology,Taussig Cancer Institute, and Department of Pathobiology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio Received12/19/07; revised 5/29/08; accepted 5/30/08.

Sunitinib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of multiple receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, which has produced robust objective responses in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) and a progression-free survival benefit over the cytokine IFNa (27). Adverse events include lymphopenia, leaving open the possibility that this drug will further impair the ability of T lymphocytes to mount an antitumor immune response. In addition, the precise mechanisms of the robust antitumor effects of sunitinib are not fully characterized. Preliminary studies reported here show that treatment with sunitinib can in fact promote a type-1 cytokine response (IFNg) and simultaneously decrease the type-2 response (IL-4) in patients with mRCC. Additional studies suggest that Treg cells may be involved in modulating changes in the type-1 and type2 cytokine responses. These findings could have implications for furthering the clinical benefit of sunitinib in RCC and other tumors. Materials andMethods Sunitinib treatment. Patients included in this study received sunitinib monotherapy for mRCC at a dose of 50 mg p.o. daily for 28 d followed by 14 d of rest, comprising one 6-wk cycle of therapy. Patients were excluded if they received any anticancer therapy concomitant with sunitinib, if they had a diagnosis other than clear cell RCC, or if they did not receive at least 28 d of sunitinib. Patients underwent disease assessment (computed tomography scans and bone scan) at baseline and after every two cycles (approximately every 12 wk). Objective response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (28) and tumor burden shrinkage was determined by investigator assessment of radiographs.

Although many CEA peptide epitopes capable of stimulating CTLs have been identified, no MHC class II-restricted T helper epitope has yet been reported. Experimental Design: The amino acid sequence of CEA was examined for the presence of potential T helper epitopes, and candidate peptides were used to stimulate in vitro T-cell responses. Results: We describe here that using an algorithm to identify promiscuous helper T-cell epitopes, a peptide of CEA occupying residue positions 653 to 667 (CEA653–667), was effective in inducing in vitro T helper responses in the context of the HLA-DR4, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DR9 alleles. Most significantly, some of the peptide-reactive helper T lymphocytes were also capable of recognizing naturally processed antigen in the form of recombinant CEA protein or cell lysates from tumors that express CEA. Interestingly, the newly identified helper T-cell epitope was found to overlap with a previously described HLA-A24-restricted CTL epitope, CEA652–660, which could facilitate the development of a therapeutic vaccine capable of eliciting both CTL and T helper responses in patients suffering from epithelial carcinomas. Conclusion: These results indicate that T helper lymphocytes are capable of recognizing CEA as a tumor antigen and that epitope CEA653–667 could be used for immunotherapy against tumors expressing CEA. INTRODUCTION CEA is an Mr 180,000 glycoprotein that is an ideal TAA for the development of immunotherapy because it is produced by most colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic carcinomas (1). Furthermore, CEA is abundantly expressed by 50% of breast cancer and 70% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (2). Several proteins from the CEA gene family such as NCA and BGP are expressed in the normal cells (e.g., neutrophils and granulocytes) and share regions of identical sequence with CEA (2). Moreover, CEA is also present (although at usually much lower concentrations) in the normal colon epithelium and in some fetal tissues. Therefore, CEA does not constitute tumor-specific antigen, creating concerns that it might either induce pathogenic immune responses to normal cells (i.e., autoimmunity) or, alternatively, be nonimmunogenic because of immune tolerance. The design and implementation of T-cell-based immunotherapy for cancer relies heavily in the identification of immunogenic T-cell peptide epitopes from TAAs capable of eliciting antitumor responses. Because MHC class I-restricted CTLs have a direct lytic effect on tumor cells, most efforts have focused on the identification of peptide epitopes capable of stimulating these types of responses. As a consequence, numerous CTL epitopes from CEA have been described, which were found to be restricted by commonly found MHC class I alleles such as HLA-A2, -A3, -A24, -B7, and -B27 (3–10). Therefore, the identification of CTL epitopes for CEA has opened the door to the development of epitope-based immunotherapy for CEAexpressing tumors. Because HTLs play an important role both in the induction and maintenance of CTL responses, vaccines that activate both CTLs and HTLs should be more effective than vaccines that only target CTL responses (11). Experiments in animal model systems have demonstrated the importance of antigen-specific HTLs in the elimination of tumors by CTLs (12–16). Moreover, using an in vitro model of human antitumor rejection mediated by CTLs, we reported recently that the presence of HTLs was critical for the eradication of the tumor cells (17). These experiments demonstrated that only in the presence of HTLs were the CTLs able to expand during the effector phase of the immune Received 4/12/02; revised 6/6/02; accepted 6/7/02.

In view of this, one obvious way to improve vaccines designed to induce antitumor CTLs is to include in these vaccines MHC class II-restricted epitopes that would trigger HTL responses to TAAs. In agreement with this assessment, several groups including ours have devoted considerable efforts to defining T-helper epitopes for various TAAs such as tyrosinase, gp100, MART1/Melan-A, NY-ESO-1, p53, and HER2/neu (18–29). In some of these cases, the identified HTL epitopes were found to be highly promiscuous with regard to their MHC class II restriction, which would allow their use in large patient populations. In the present study, we used a computer-based algorithm (30) to identify peptide sequences from CEA with potential promiscuous MHC class II binding characteristics. Using this approach, we selected peptide CEA653–667, which was found to be effective in generating in vitro HTL responses restricted by the HLA-DR4, -DR7, and -DR9 alleles. More importantly, some of the peptide-generated HTLs were also capable of recognizing naturally processed antigen in the form of recombinant CEA protein or cell lysates prepared from CEA-positive tumors. The present findings should hold some value for the development of epitope-based vaccines to elicit CTL and HTL responses against CEA-expressing tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines. EBV-LCLs were produced from PBMCs of HLA-typed volunteers using culture supernatant from the EBVproducing B95-8 cell line. Mouse fibroblast cell lines (L-cells) transfected and expressing individual human MHC class II molecules were kindly provided by Dr. R. W. Karr (Pfizer Global R&D, New London, CT) and by Dr. T. Sasazuki (Fukuoka, Japan). The colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW403, the Jurkat T-cell lymphoma, and the IL-2-dependent CTLL cell line were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The colon carcinoma cell line WiDr was supplied by the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Synthetic Peptide and Recombinant Antigens. Potential HLA-DR promiscuous CD4 T-cell epitopes were selected from the amino acid sequence of CEA using the algorithm tables for three HLA-DR alleles (DRB1*0101, DRB1*0401, and DRB1*0701) described by Southwood et al. (30). The selected peptide, CEA653–667 (YACFVSNLATGRNNS), which displayed high algorithm scores, was synthesized by solid phase organic chemistry and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The purity ( 80%) and identity of peptide were assessed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Recombinant CEA protein was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant Hpcal 1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein. The Hpcal 1 protein was concentrated, and the purity of the protein was verified by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Induction of Antigen-specific HTL Lines with Synthetic Peptide. The procedure selected for the generation of tumor antigen-reactive HTL lines using peptide-stimulated PBMCs has been described in detail (21–23). Briefly, DCs were produced in tissue culture from adherent monocytes that were cultured for 7 days at 37°C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator in the presence of 50 ng/ml granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor and 1000 IU/ml IL-4. Peptide-pulsed DCs (3 g/ml for 2 h at room temperature) were irradiated (4200 rad) and cocultured with autologous purified CD4 T cells (using antibody-coated magnetic microbeads from Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) in round-bottomed, 96-well culture plates. One week later, the CD4 T cells were restimulated with peptide-pulsed irradiated autologous PBMCs, and 2 days later, human recombinant IL-2 was added at a final concentration of 10 IU/ml. One week later, the T-cells were tested for their proliferative responses to peptide as described below. Those cultures exhibiting a proliferative response to peptide (at least 3-fold over background) were expanded in 24or 48-well plates by weekly restimulation with peptides and irradiated autologous PBMCs. Complete culture medium for all procedures consisted of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% human male AB serum, 0.1 mM MEM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 50 g/ml gentamicin. The Institutional Review Board on Human Subjects (Mayo Foundation) approved this research, and informed consent for blood donation was obtained from all volunteers. Measurement of Antigen-specific Responses with HTL Lines. CD4 T cells (3 10/well) were mixed with irradiated APCs in the presence of various concentrations of antigen (peptides, recombinant proteins, or tumor lysates) in 96-well culture plates. APCs consisted of either PBMCs (1 10/well), HLA-DR-expressing L-cells (3 10/well), EBV-LCLs (3 10/well), or DCs (5 10/well). Tumor cell lysates were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles of 1 10 tumor cells, resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640. Lysates were used as a source of antigen at 5 10 cell ', 'Hiroya Kobayashi, R. Omiya, M. Ruiz, E. Huarte, P. Sarobe, J. Lasarte, M. Herraiz, B. Sangro, J. Prieto, F. Borrás-Cuesta, E. Celis'),

This study shows that there is a significant association between mode of delivery and initiation of breast feeding. The prevalence of early initiation of breast feeding among normal deliveries and caesarean deliveries was 71.3% and 41.5% respectively. This study was supported by the study done by Ashmika Motee et al (2013) which reveals that 42.6% of normally delivered mothers and 23.9% of caesarean delivered mothers had initiated breast feeding within one hour. For caesarean delivered mothers, management of pain along with support of family members and health care providers, helps in early initiation of breast feeding.', 'Shalini S, G.

Taking care of a baby requires parental adjustment and behavioural development in order to satisfy child’s needs. Infant massage is an important parental support strategy which enhances parent-child relationship and promotes baby’s development [1]. This is a widely and effective technique used in preterm and term infants. In recent years, many studies showed several benefits, such as improved weight gain; pain reduction; relaxation; increased alertness and learning; decreased stress, depression and anxiety levels; promoted deep sleep and improved immune system [2–4]. However, when evaluating term massage programs, it is noticed that there are no similar methodologies between studies. The purpose of this study is to review massage programs for newborn babies. Materials and methods This is a systematic review study. A literature search was conducted via three databases: PubMed, PEDro and Scielo using the search terms “Massage therapy”; “Infant massage”; “Baby massage”; “Full term”; “term babies”; “neonates”, “newborn” and “Maternal support” or “Mother support”. The inclusion criteria were: Studies published in English, Spanish or Portuguese; RCT studies; Quasi-experimental studies; Studies with massage program; Studies with term babies’ samples; Studies published between 2009 and 2019. The exclusion criteria were studies with term “babies with congenital disease”. A total of 62 papers were found and analysed by both authors. Fourteen met the criteria, 5 RCT’s and 9 quasi experimental studies. Results Studies described 6 programs of infant massage to newborn babies. Ten studies described mothers applying term massage program, 3 applied by health professionals and 1 divided between health professionals when in hospital and by their mothers when babies were discharged. The most representative direction of massage was from head to feet. Majority of the studies used group strategy for teaching infant massage to mothers. Programs varied from 1–3 days twice a day for 15 mn to once a week between 30–60 mn during 4–8 weeks. Studies were scored by PEDro’s scale and ranged from 2 to 7. Half of the studies obtained score 5. Discussion and conclusion We can conclude that 6 massage programs are described in literature; the majority is performed by babies’ mothers and there is a wide variety concerning program duration and frequency. Studies outcomes showed effects both on newborn babies and mother–baby relationship. Infant massage programs seem to be an important group teaching strategy for new parents. However, more studies should be done in order to understand if newborn massage works, regardless of the program type.', 'Sónia Vicente, Ângela Pereira'),

The pain endured during and in between treatment can be minimized with sedation. These sedations, however, are not without side effects and risks. Given the potential complications, we devised a Burn Analgesic Treatment Protocol that incorporates safe analgesia during burn treatment and throughout the day, thus minimizing the necessity for sedations.\n\n\nAIMS\nAssessment of the effectiveness of the analgesic protocol by quantification of overall number of sedations needed for burn treatment and by assessment of the overall experience of the treating medical team exposed to burn care before and after implementation of the protocol.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective analysis of analgesic treatment regimens among admitted pediatric burn patients both before and after the implementation of our analgesic protocol was performed. Furthermore, questionnaires were given to the nurses of the treating medical team in order to better assess overall experience with the new analgesic protocol.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 87 patients were treated with the new analgesic protocol and 46 patients served as the control group. A significantly lower number of sedations were performed in the group treated with the new protocol compared to the control group (18% vs 30%, p=0.057). The questionnaires filled out by the treating nurses revealed an average score of 4.5 (between 1 - 5), indicating high satisfaction with the protocol.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur new analgesic protocol allows for highly effective treatment of burn wounds while minimizing the necessity for sedations, thus increasing overall patient safety and reducing potential complications.', 'Hila Alfassi, Yair Shcachar, A.

Previous studies propose differences in temperature and light quantity as main sources of deviations between indoor and outdoor plant growth. With increasing implementation of light emitting diodes (LED) in plant growth facilities, light quality is yet another factor that can be optimised to prevent unnatural plant performance. We investigated the effects of different wavelength combinations in phytotrons (i.e., indoor growth chambers) on plant growth and physiology in seven different plant species from different plant functional types (herbs, grasses and trees). The results from these experiments were compared against a previous field trial with the same set of species. While different proportions of blue (B) and red (R) light were applied in the phytotrons, the mean environmental conditions (photoperiod, total radiation, red to far red ratio and day/night temperature and air humidity) from the field trial were used in the phytotrons in order to assess which wavelength combinations result in the most natural-like plant performance. Different plant traits and physiological parameters, including biomass productivity, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf pigmentation, photosynthesis under a standardised light, and the respective growing light and chlorophyll fluorescence, were measured at the end of each treatment. The exposure to different B percentages induced species-specific dose response reactions for most of the analysed parameters. Compared with intermediate B light treatments (25 and/or 35% B light), extreme R or B light enriched treatments (6% and 62% of B respectively) significantly affected the height, biomass, biomass allocation, chlorophyll content, and photosynthesis parameters, differently among species. Principal component analyses (PCA) confirmed that 6% and 62% B light quality combinations induce more extreme plant performance in most cases, indicating that light quality needs to be adjusted to mitigate unnatural plant responses under indoor conditions.', 'Camilo Chiang, Daniel Bånkestad, G.

Earlier studies regarding artificial light (AL) during the night predominantly covered the drastic effects on animal systems. Although, drastic effects of AL during night time are enormous; therefore, the present topic is focused on the physiological and ecological consequences of artificial night light pollution (ANLP) on plant systems. In these consequences, most of the plant processes under ANLP are affected intensely and cause compelling changes in plant life cycle from germination to maturity. However, severe effects were observed in the case of pollination, photoreceptor signalling, flowering and microhabitats of plants. Along with drastic effects on ecology and environments, its relevance to human developmental processes cannot be avoided. Therefore, we need to equipoise between sustainable environment and steadily human development processes. Further, selection of plant/crop species, which are more responsive to ANLP, can minimize the ecological consequences of night light pollution. Likewise, changing artificial nightscape with the implication of new LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) lightening policies like UJALA (www.ujala.gov.in), which are low cost, more durable, eco-friendly and less emitter of CO2, have potential to overcome the biodiversity threats, which arise due to old artificial lightening technology from decades. Hence, adopting new advance artificial lightening technology and understanding its impact on plant ecosystem will be a future challenge for plant biologist.', 'Rajesh Kumar Singhal, Manish Kumar, B.

Previous authors proposed that differences in temperature, light quantity, and the lack of their variation are sources of deviations between indoor and outdoor experiments. Here, we investigated the effect of fluctuating light, temperature, and humidity in an indoor environment on plant performance. Seven plant species from different functional plant types were grown outdoors during summer and spring. The same species were then grown in indoor growth chambers under different scenarios of climate complexity in terms of fluctuations of temperature, air humidity, and light: (1) fixed night and day conditions, (2) daily sinusoidal changes, and (3) variable conditions tracking the climate records from the field trials. In each scenario, the average of the environmental variables was the same as in the respective field trial. Productivity-, gas exchange-, and leaf pigment-traits were measured in all plants at the end of the experiments. The plant trait responses were highly dependent on species and treatment, but general trends were observed. The variable condition yielded lower biomass compared to the fixed and sinusoidal conditions, together with a higher specific leaf area and increased chlorophyll concentrations. A principal component analysis (PCA) across all plant traits in response to climatic conditions suggested that at least a sinusoidal fluctuation is recommended for a more natural-like plant performance in indoor growth facilities. However, prevailing significant differences for several traits between field- and indoor-grown plants even under variable climates indicate that additional factors other than those controllable in standard phytotrons (e.g., wind speed and direction, leaf and soil temperature) can still significantly bias plant performance in indoor facilities.', 'Camilo Chiang, Daniel Bånkestad, G.

Here, plants were monitored diurnally and nocturnally throughout the flowering period to evaluate arthropod activity that might impact pollination. Ultraviolet photographs and spectrophotometric data were collected on flowers. Canopy light penetrance was measured at plants. Seed capsule production was evaluated over time. In sum, 41 flowers were monitored for > 300 h, resulting in > 140,000 photographic frames of compiled video. In this extensive monitoring, 33 plant–arthropod interactions were detected, only one likely to facilitate self-pollination, and none that facilitated outcrossing. UV absorbance was identified on petals and sepals, which contrasted starkly with whorl UV reflectance, a previously undescribed form of floral display visible to pollinators. Flowering plants grew in higher light than vegetative ones.

Tagged null mutants of OHP1 and OHP2 (ohp1 and ohp2) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that ohp1 deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic ohp1 plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly.

Besides, PhyCys are involved in plant reactions to abiotic stresses like drought or darkness and have been used as effective molecules against different pests and pathogens. The barley PhyCys-CysProt system is considered a model of protease-inhibitor regulation of protein turnover. Thirteen barley cystatins (HvCPI-1 to HvCPI-13) have been previously identified and characterized. Among them HvCPI-2 has been shown to have a relevant role in plant responses to pathogens and pests, as well as in the plant response to drought.ResultsThe present work explores the multiple role of this barley PhyCys in response to both, biotic and abiotic stresses, focusing on the impact of silencing this gene. HvIcy-2 silencing lines behave differentially against the phytopathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and a light deprivation treatment. The induced expression of HvIcy-2 by the fungal stress correlated to a higher susceptibility of silencing HvIcy-2 plants.

Growth plasticity in these organs is achieved through a complex network of molecular signals. Besides conveying information from the environment, this signaling network also transduces internal signals, such as those associated with the circadian clock. A number of studies performed in Arabidopsis hypocotyls, and to a lesser degree in petioles, have been informative for understanding the signaling networks that regulate elongation of aerial plant organs. In particular, substantial progress has been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate responses to light, the circadian clock, and temperature. Signals derived from these three stimuli converge on the BAP module, a set of three different types of transcription factors that interdependently promote gene transcription and growth. Additional key positive regulators of growth that are also affected by environmental cues include the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) E3 ubiquitin ligase proteins. In this review, we summarize the key signaling pathways that regulate growth of hypocotyls and petioles, focusing specifically on molecular mechanisms important for transducing signals derived from light, the circadian clock, and temperature.

A high yielding submergence intolerant rice cultivar IR64 was tested against its SUB1 QTL introgressed counterpart (IR64-Sub1) for 12 days of complete submergence for different spacing treatments in field tanks. Relatively wider spaced plants showed higher individual plant biomass and early seedling vigour, which was particularly helpful for IR64 in increasing plant survival (by 150% in S6 over S1) under 12 days of submergence, whereas the improvement was less in IR64-Sub1 (13%). Underwater radiation inside the plant canopy, particularly beyond 40 cm water depth, was significantly greater in wider spacing treatments. Leaf senescence pattern captured by SPAD chlorophyll meter reading and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging data (Fm, Fv/Fm) taken at different time intervals after stress imposition suggested that there was lesser light penetration inside the canopy of closer spaced plants, and that it might hasten leaf senescence and damage to the photosynthetic system. The initial content of total non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) was higher in wider spaced plants of IR64, and also the rate of depletion of NSC was lesser compared with closer spaced plants. In contrast, there was not much difference in NSC depletion rate under different spacing in IR64-Sub1. Further, higher antioxidant enzyme activities in wider spaced plants (both IR64 and IR64-Sub1) after de-submergence indicated better stress recovery and improved tolerance. Taken together we found that wider spacing (row-row: 20 cm and plant-plant: 15 cm and more) can significantly improve submergence tolerance ability in rice, particularly in submergence intolerant non-Sub1 cultivar like IR64, perhaps due to better underwater light penetration, delayed leaf senescence and slower depletion of NSC reserve.', 'D.

Because their development relied heavily upon biotechnology methods, especially in connection with target discovery, these small-molecule products are also sometimes referred to as biotech drugs (as in the list of biotech drugs maintained by the Biotechnology Industry Organization [BIO]). In this paper, the term “biotech drug” includes such drugs. Essential Characteristics Of Targeted Biotech Drugs Our focus in this paper is on pricing and competition. Two aspects of biotech drugs stand out. Their most characteristic feature, obviously, is their ability to address biological targets with unprecedented precision. We emphasize, however, that a narrow biological target does not imply a narrow therapeutic effect. A specific target may play diverse roles in the human body, in which case a drug acting on that target may find multiple uses for very different conditions. Thus, Rituxan, originally approved for cancer, has also been approved for RA. Avastin, approved for cancer, is also prescribed off-label for macular degeneration. Remicade is approved for Crohn’s disease, arthritis, and colitis; and the HIV drug Viread may be effective against hepatitis B. A second essential feature of large-molecule drugs is the absence of a regulatory pathway to generic substitutes after relevant patents expire. In theory, the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act, which gave birth to today’s vigorous generic drug industry, could apply to the few older biotech drugs (mainly hormones and insulins) that passed through the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research rather than the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. As a general rule, however, most biotech drugs are so complex in their makeup and manufacturing that there is no clear way to apply the bioequivalence standard that undergirds generic drug approvals. Nonetheless, patent expirations for the initial wave of biotech drugs have generated considerable pressure to permit competing “biosimilar” drugs to enter the market. European regulators have already approved biosimilar drugs for human growth hormone, while the FDA has yet to make clear how these products could obtain U.S. approval. The FDA appears to be constructing an informal sliding-scale approach, however. While so-called follow-on biologics will not be treated as therapeutically equivalent to pioneer brands, they might not always have to traverse the full sequence of clinical trials required of the pioneer. Rather, clinical trial requirements will vary with products and indications. These circumstances strongly indicate that for the foreseeable future, biosimilar drugs will exert no more than a modest effect on postpatent prices of targeted large-molecule drugs. The Short-Run Implications For Biotech Drug Pricing Some biotech drugs are entering large markets to compete like traditional “blockbuster” therapeutics for conditions such as RA and osteoporosis. But, in T a r g e t e d T h e r a p e u t i c s H E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 2 5 , N u m b e r 5 1 3 0 3 general, most targeted biotech drugs do things no other drug can do. Even two biotech drugs for the same cancer may be active against entirely different subsets of that cancer. This suggests implications for foreign price controls. Those controls rely on government exercise of monopsony power, which we would expect to be more effective against sellers of competing traditional drugs within a therapeutic category than against manufacturers of unique biotech drugs. This is borne out by price data. We obtained price and revenue data from IMS Health for forty-three top-selling drugs in 2004, including seven large-molecule biotech drugs, supplemented by an additional fourteen biotech drugs, of which all but two were large molecules. We also separated modern targeted therapeutics from first-generation biotech drugs, such as human insulin, human growth hormone, interferons, and red and white blood cell–stimulating factors. Most of these pioneer biotech drugs were developed to treat deficiencies of biological substances before scientific understanding permitted the identity of more precise targets. Exhibit 1 compares foreign prices to U.S. prices: first for the thirty-six bestselling traditional drugs in the United States in 2004, then for the full sample of biotech drugs, and finally for a subsample that excludes first-generation biotech drugs. It is apparent that relative to the United States, targeted drugs were priced far higher abroad than nonbiotech drugs and were essentially at parity with U.S. prices in Canada and France. Second-generation targeted drugs tended to be priced somewhat above U.S. levels. The Coming Dynamics Of Biotech Drug Pricing Whether or not biotech drugs will continue to exercise a sort of immunity to ordinary pricing pressures, including foreign price controls, is far from clear. Because the industry is relatively new, there is little reason to think that what we observe today will characterize markets five or ten or twenty years from now. Several partly offsetting forces are at work. Chasing QALYs. The ability of biotech drug developers to create tightly targeted drugs, combined with the absence of a regulatory pathway to generics, would 1 3 0 4 S e p t e m b e r / O c t o b e r 2 0 0 6 E v o l u t i o n & F u t u r e EXHIBIT 1 Relative Price Indices For Traditional And Targeted Drugs In Five Developed Countries Relative To The United States (U.S. = 1.00), 2004 Australia Canada France Germany U.K. Traditional drugs 22 biotech drugs Second-generation targeted drugs 0.45 0.78 1.15 0.50 0.99 1.11 0.45 0.94 1.25 0.48 0.75 1.13 0.54 0.75 1.04 SOURCES: For thirty-six traditional drugs, J.E.

Biotechnology has provided an increasing supply of new drugs that do things that have never been done before, radically altering the treatment of such previously impervious conditions as multiple sclerosis (MS), RA, and, of course, certain cancers. We can expect the supply of expensive new biotech drugs to continue unabated even if payers systematically limit reimbursement to consensus recommendations for how much to pay per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. As long as advanced societies are willing to pay on the order of $50,000 or more per QALY, creative biotechnology firms will find solutions that meet such standards and will price them accordingly. Postapproval research. The relationship between research and development (R&D) and the lack of generic entry bears emphasis. Research on traditional drugs normally ceases as patent expirations approach. The burden of conducting research on an important therapeutic class is typically assumed by follow-on drugs (as happened most notably with the statins). But a steady succession of patent expirations and generic entries will eventually deplete research incentives, as happened with the important class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until', 'J.

Thus, if biofuels production is to create economic growth without jeopardising our natural capital and social equity, it must be developed in the framework of well thought-out national policy.Biofuels public policy cannot ignore national objectives, which involve not only agro productive specialization, but also expanding the availability of energy to the population and protecting the natural patrimony. Accordingly, it is incumbent on each country to define its own agenda, taking advantage of the demand from the developed countries as a means of solving their own problems and creating new opportunities for sustainable rural development. Given the complex, multi-dimensional nature of biofuels policymaking-as will be outlined in this paper-it is only under certain conditions that biofuels production programmes can contribute to sustainable development.A significant number of the region\'s countries have set goals for the local market, and have passed legislation to develop biofuels, without a thorough examination of the impacts that such development may entail in terms of agriculture and natural resource use, as well as in the social sphere-particularly as regards poverty reduction and food prices.Thus, it remains to define a policy agenda which can assure a real contribution to sustainable development. In other words, though biofuels production clearly has microeconomic benefits, especially in terms of agribusiness, a number of questions must be examined carefully before policy is put in place:The net balance of biofuels programmes, in terms of fossil fuel energy, must be studied, examining the effect of replacing oil products for domestic consumption (especially in the transportation sector) in relation to the consumption of fossil fuel energy throughout all links of the biofuels production chain. If this balance is not significantly positive, biofuels programmes will risk creating other negative impacts for import-dependent countries, without any compensation whatsoever in terms of fossil energy savings or foreign reserve levels.If the above-mentioned balance is not significantly positive, it must be determined whether the introduction of biofuels will actually have a positive effect on greenhouse gas emissions and contribute permanently to achieving the ultimate objective of the Framework Convention on Climate Change. In the case of biofuels production based primarily on monocultures, an assessment must be made regarding the impact on the social conditions affecting the labour market, concentration of property, and social distribution of the gains. If monocultures predominate strongly, biofuels programmes could ultimately have a negative impact on employment, on reducing distributive asymmetries, and on rural development. There are marked differences between the region\'s countries in regard to production and use of biofuels, natural resources, previous experience and technological development, availability of alternative energy sources for transportation, degree to which the basic energy needs of populations are being met, and poverty and under-nutrition. Thus, no single, across-the-board criteria on the appropriateness of biofuels programmes can be considered valid.Countries with long experience producing and using bioethanol, with advanced technological development in all links of the productive chain, a mature automobile industry and a very large domestic market could become large exporters of that fuel. In the case of major vegetable oil exporters that also have abundant natural resources, there are actors willing to become involved in the export of biodiesel. However, in terms of natural resources, biodiversity and exacerbating social asymmetries, serious risks could accrue.As a general matter, it is quite possible that the impact on agricultural activity could be minimal provided that biofuels production does not bring with it greater technology to increase the productivity of existing types of crops, or provides a means of extending the agricultural frontier in a sustainable fashion. At the same time, however, better management of soil and water resources will be needed, and existing varieties must be improved, along with the use of any new varieties that can be appropriately adapted to the ecological conditions.In those of the region\'s countries that are poor in natural resources, and in some that suffer from marked poverty, under-nutrition and/or inadequate coverage of basic energy needs, exporting is not a sustainable option, since it would have negative effects on various aspects of sustainable development.ECLAC has been emphasising that, in addition to expanding supply-which may have unpredictable impacts on a planetary scale, given sharply rising energy consumption-greater priority should be given to moderating consumption, especially in the developed countries. Thus, energy saving appears much more compatible with sustainable development than do biofuels, which are at best a marginal, short-term solution to central problems of energy and the environment.Since there has been little actual regional or national public policy experience with biofuels in Latin America and the Caribbean, this monograph defines certain types of different scenarios, as a means of dealing with the complexity of the analytical challenge. From the point of view of sustainable development, perhaps the proper approach would be to meet the population\'s basic energy needs through rural development policies. This approach would place priority on the problems of poverty, indigence and under-nutrition, while guarding against the distributive asymmetries and displacement of small producers that biofuels production could cause.Such problems, of course, go far beyond the scope of this document. Here, we limit ourselves to looking, by way of example, at policymaking issues in countries that fall under four different categories:countries that are dependent on crude oil and/or oil products, that have balance of payments problems due to their high energy bill, and whose coverage of their population\'s basic energy needs is low;countries that are dependent on petroleum, and whose coverage of their populations\' basic energy needs is moderate;countries that have a variety of energy resources and could diversify their energy matrix further by producing bioethanol and/or biodiesel, but that are nonetheless importers of oil products; andcountries whose comparative advantages and place in the technological learning curve provide them entry to the world market.Finally, the perspective adopted here is that the overall public policy approach to biofuels production and use should be multi-dimensional and must be managed in a centralised fashion. Thus, participation must not be limited to energy authorities, but must also draw on input from relevant government entities concerned with agriculture, industry and transportation, finance, natural resources and environment, social areas such as health, and regional entities. A coherent biofuels policy can only be built on the basis of common agreement and adequate information. Once such governmental consensus is achieved, reactions and contributions from civil society can be incorporated in formulating policy. In short, the rules governing investment in biofuels must flow from a comprehensive approach, rather than merely from individual points of view.This document was prepared in the framework of the project, Towards sustainable and equitable globalization.

Lewis blood group epitopes, in particular, seem to remarkably contribute to the beneficial effects of HMO. In this regard, large-scale functional human studies could provide evidence of the variety of results from in vitro investigations, although increasing the amount and complexity of sample and data handling. Therefore, reliable screening approaches are needed. To predict the oligosaccharide pattern in milk, the routine serological Lewis blood group typing of blood samples can be applied due to the close relationship between the biosynthesis of HMO and the Lewis antigens on erythrocytes. However, the actual HMO profile of the individual samples does not necessarily correspond to the serological determinations. This review demonstrates the capabilities of merging the traditional serological Lewis blood group typing with the additional information provided by the comprehensive elucidation of individual HMO patterns by means of state-of-the-art analytics. Deduced from the association of the suggested HMO biosynthesis with the Lewis blood group, the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiles of oligosaccharides in individual milk samples exemplify the advantages and the limitations of sample assignment to distinct groups. Adv. Nutr. 3: 440S–449S, 2012. Introduction Free lactose-derived oligosaccharides in human milk (HMO) are present at concentrations ranging approximately from 10 to 20 g/L; hence, several grams of these unique components pass through the breast-fed infant’s gut daily (1–3). Various health protective actions have been deduced from in vitro investigations, i.e., prebiotic, anti-infective, or immune effects (4,5), which might partially be associated with the presence of fucosylated oligosaccharide structures. Those are determined by the expression of the secretor (Se) and Lewis (Le) genes in the mammary gland. Hence, distinct patterns of milk oligosaccharides according to the Le/Se types Le(a+b2) non-Se, Le(a2b+) Se, and Le(a2b2) Se or non-Se genes have been described by several investigators (2,6,7). The prevalence in white individuals averages 22%, 72%, and 6%, respectively (8), whereas 80% of the Europeans secrete ABH substances in saliva and other secretions; thus, they are typed as Se (9,10). Observational studies indicate that certain HMO from Secretor are associated with various preventive effects, such as reducing diarrhea and promoting intestinal maturation in preterm neonates (11,12). 6 Abbreviations used: Fuc, fucose; FucT, fucosyltransferase; HMO, human milk oligosaccharide; Le, Lewis; LN(n)H, lacto-N-(neo)hexaose; LN(n)T, lacto-N-(neo)tetraose; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; RBC, red blood cell; Se, secretor. 1 Published in a supplement to Advances in Nutrition.

D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /advances/arttract/3/3/440S/4644568 by gest on 05 Feruary 2019 The final evidence of the functionality of the Le-related HMO compounds in humans has to be confirmed by intervention studies with large numbers of participants. Therefore, reliable high-throughput screening methods are needed to determine the oligosaccharide profiles in individual milk samples. Due to high interand intraindividual variations in HMO expression, the relationship between the serologically detectable Le blood group and the corresponding oligosaccharide pattern in milk can only be used for a crude milk classification, even though serological detection as a routine method is rapid and highly practicable. Nevertheless, detailed information on the HMO composition in milk samples provides a more accurate indication of the substances actually ingested by the infant. For this purpose, new developments in the field of glycomics have great potential for facilitating the handling of large sample and data sets from follow-up investigations on the correlation of Le-active components in infants’ feeding and their health (13–15). In this review, we demonstrate the correlation of the serologically detected Le blood group and the expressed HMO pattern in the milk of the donors and show how this information can be enhanced by recent high-throughput HMO screening methods. On the basis of the suggested biosynthesis of HMO, specific variances in the HMO pattern are taken as examples to highlight the necessity of careful individual milk sample analysis. Biosynthesis of Le and Se gene-related oligosaccharides in milk In the past years, the structures of the major HMO have been thoroughly characterized (16,17). From these data, some structural rules have been deduced and the biosynthetic pathways of the neutral HMO have been proposed (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, experimental data on the biosynthesis of HMO are lacking to date. Because the reducing end of the unbound oligosaccharides from milk consistently contains lactose, which is the major macronutrient in human milk, this disaccharide is assumed to be the initial substrate for HMO synthesis. Lactose is formed in the Golgi apparatus by the action of the lactose synthase complex containing a-lactalbumin and b1–4galactosyltransferase (18). UDP-activated galactose is attached to Glc-I-P with high affinity due to the presence of a-lactalbumin, which is only expressed in the lactating mammary gland of mammals. We speculate that analogous to theO-glycosylation of proteins in the Golgi of submaxillary and gastrointestinal secreting cells, the glycosyltransferases for HMO synthesis might occur as membrane-bound glycoproteins and process the oligosaccharide sequentially by the addition of a single monosaccharide from sugar nucleotides. Those are synthesized in the cytosol and conveyed to the Golgi lumen via specific membrane antiporters, e.g., GLUT1 for monophosphorylated glucose (19–21). Thus, elongation (a), branching (b), and fucosylation (c) of lactose and derived structures might be performed by the concerted action of (a) ib1–3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and b1–3and b1–4-galactosyltransferase for type 1 and type 2 chains, respectively, and (b) Ib1–6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase as depicted in Figure 1. Following the suggested rules of HMO synthesis, no further elongation is observed for a terminal type 1 chain (indicated by a no entry sign in Figure 1) (7,22,23). The final fucosylation and Le antigen formation is achieved by the consecutive action of a1–2-, a1–3-, or a1–3/4-fucosyltransferases (FucT)(c), as summarized in Figure 2. The presence of at least 1 functional allele of the Le gene results in the expression of an a1–3/4-FucT (FucTIII), which is able to attach GDP-activated fucose (Fuc) in the O-4 position to N-acetylglucosamine in type 1 (Galb1– 3GlcNAc) chains, resulting in Le epitopes, as shown in Figure 1. The same enzyme forms O-3-Fuc units at the Nacetylglucosamine residue of type 2 (Galb1–4GlcNAc) chains yielding Le and, in Secretors, Le epitopes, however with lower specificity than for type 1 substrates due to steric aspects (24). The O-3-fucosylation of the reducing glucose residue is known to be accomplished by the Le-gene–dependent FucTIII as well (25). Furthermore, the formation of Le and Le epitopes can also be performed by different a1–3-FucTs, i.e., FucTIII–VII and FucTIX (26). Although secretory tissues and fluids have predominantly FucTII activity encoded by the Se gene, i.e., milk (27–29), saliva, or stomach tissue (30), in human serum, both FucTII and the H gene–controlled FucTI are present (31). Both enzymes transfer GDP-activated Fuc in a1–2-position to b-Dgalactosides prior to the formation of Le and Le epitopes (Fig. 1). The Le and Se gene–encoded FucTs compete for the substrates so that in Secretors Le structures are also found in milk and other secretions, but not on erythrocytes or in plasma (29,32). Individuals with mutations resulting in the nonfunctional FucTs FucTII and FucTIII are usually typed as nonSe and Le negative or Le(a2b2), respectively (26,33) and therefore should not secrete a1–2and/or a1–4-fucosylated structures into milk.

Due to its high economic toll and its impact on personal freedom, we need to ease social distancing and deploy alternative measures, while preventing a second wave of infections. Bluetooth app-based contact tracing has been proposed, focusing on symptomatic cases and isolating their contacts. However, this approach would miss many transmissions by asymptomatic cases. To improve effectiveness of app-based mitigation, we propose to complement contact tracing with Smart Testing relying on Contact Counting (STeCC). STeCC focuses virus RNA testing to people with exceptionally high numbers of contacts. These people are at particularly high risk to become infected (with or without symptoms) and transmit the virus. Mathematical modeling shows that a mitigation strategy combining STeCC and contact tracing in one app will be more efficient than contact tracing and works when ≈50% (instead of ≥60%) of the total population participate. Similarly, it requires 50-100 fold less tests than randomized virus testing alone. These gains in efficiency may be critical for success. STeCC could be integrated in the current Bluetooth tracing apps. Thus, STeCC is technically feasible and can reduce the pandemic’s reproduction number by 2.4-fold (e.g. from R0=2.4 to Reff=1) with realistic test numbers (≈166 per 100’000 people per day), when a realistic fraction of the population would use the app (i.e. ≈50% in total population). Thereby, STeCC efficiently complements the portfolio of mitigation strategies, which allow easing social distancing without compromising public health.', 'H. Gorji, M. Arnoldini, D.

Secondary attack rates of 283 AIC were significant (0.02) but lower than those of the 567 symptomatic index cases (SIC; 0.04). AIC infected on average 0.6 contacts, only slightly less than SIC (0.7 contacts). Higher values but similar differences were found within households. These results are in line with 13 other studies including 111 AIC, reviewed in a recent meta-analysis [2]. Transmission rates of AIC ranged from 0 2.2% compared to 0.8 15.4% for SIC [2]. Another meta-analysis found that household transmission from AIC was 0 4.9% compared to 18.0%; for SIC [3]. In another household study, AIC were four times less likely to pass the virus to a household contact, but ultimately caused one fifth of household infections [4]. All of these studies agree that AIC transmit SARS-COV2 to contacts, although to a somewhat lesser extent than SIC. However, a large study from post-lockdown Wuhan came to a very different conclusion [5]. After 11 weeks, the total lockdown was lifted by April 8th, 2020. Between April 8th and May 10th only 6 new COVID19 cases were confirmed. Four days later (May 14th), the city embarked on a comprehensive 19-days screening effort including 92% of its residents irrespective of their COVID19-status. Among 34.424 recovered COVID19 patients, 107 tested positive, corresponding to 310 per 100.000 patients. Among those without COVID19 history, there were no new symptomatic cases detected, but 300 asymptomatic PCR-positive cases (3 per 100.000). The 1.174 close contacts of these AIC were all PCR-negative and none became positive during isolation. The authors concluded that asymptomatic PCR-positive individuals do not transmit the virus to others [5]. How can this apparent disparity be reconciled? Several lines of evidence suggest that the epidemiological context in Wuhan was very different from the one in Luxembourg and most other studies.', 'C. Muller'),

Moreover, indirect pathways from student characteristics to GPA via food insecurity partially mediated associations between student characteristics and GPA.

While in-class collaborative learning has been relatively well-explored, very little is known about how medical students engage in informal SSL or about the impacts it can have. The purpose of this study was to explore medical students’ practices and perceptions regarding SSL, and the ways in which this shaped their overall learning experiences. Approach: A constructivist grounded theory study was conducted at the University of Calgary. Data were collected from 23 semi-structured student interviews, which were audio recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using iterative data collection, memo-ing, and focused coding. Findings: Despite SSL being a common part of students’ medical school experience and something that was promoted by academic advisors, how students actually engaged with SSL varied substantially, including who made use of SSL, how they made use of it, the size and focus of SSL groups, how these groups functioned, and what individuals sought to get out of them. Some students found SSL helped them to be more efficient and focused in their studying, while others benefited from comparing their knowledge and skills with those of their peers. Not everyone benefited, as some students found SSL stressful, unproductive, or socially uncomfortable. While student engagement in SSL was an enabler of academic success for some it could also be an indicator of social isolation and low self-esteem for others. Insights: Understanding how SSL can influence student experiences has the potential to inform students how and why they might engage in SSL, and it can help educators better support their students, particularly in those schools that actively encourage SSL.', 'Daniela Keren, J.

He wrote most extensively on rockets and space travel. One of Ley’s most successful books was Rockets, Missiles and Space Travel, first published in 1944. It went through twenty-one editions, was published in numerous languages, and over the years grew from 271 to 557 pages in length. In 1944, Germany launched the first V-2 rockets at London, Antwerp and Paris. At war’s end, many of the engineers involved in the V-2 programme, most notably Wernher von Braun, entered the United States. Ley had known von Braun from the days of the Society for Space Travel. Von Braun and other rocket engineers explained to Ley what had happened in Germany between 1933 and 1945. In time, as space flight became a topic of rapidly growing interest to the US public with the onset of the ‘space race’, Ley became in effect a sort of public spokesman for this group. Ley, however, had been fed bowdlerized accounts of the German rocket programme that left out the brutality and inhumanity of the treatment of the slave labourers forced to build both the rockets and the construction facilities. Thousands died in the process. Buss makes clear that it was not only through his writings and interviews that Ley exerted influence. The director Fritz Lang credited Ley as the inspiration for Lang’s famous 1929 film Frau im Mond. Although Ley had little direct role in the 1950 Destination Moon, Hollywood’s big launch into space travel, the chief technical adviser, science fiction author Robert Heinlein, used Ley’s Rockets, Missiles and Space Travel as a reference text. Ley was, however, the principal adviser for Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, a television series that premiered in 1950 and ran on the CBS network just before the main evening news broadcast. It became one of the longest-running shows of the era. Airing three times a week, it featured the adventures of a space cadet and his crew in 2350 as they toured the solar system. Among other things, Ley reviewed the ideas of the shows’ writers to check if they were scientifically plausible. For the first in-depth work on Ley’s career, Buss has crafted an absorbing, well-researched and carefully contextualized study. He makes a convincing case that Ley was not just a famous rocket expert, but a publicist of space flight, a ‘showman of the space age’ (p. 8) and someone who, through his writing, put himself at the centre of the scientific enterprise.

Fields\' PhD dissertation. It presents an annotated translation, with explanatory introduction, of a text (Anonymus Dialogus cum ludaeis = ADI) that purports to record a dialogue between a Jew and a Christian who attempts to convince him that the beliefs that make Christianity distinctive the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Virgin Birth, the whole earthly life of Christ ana Christ\'s second coming in glory are all prefigured in the Old Testament. The text is a typical piece of adversus-Judaeos argumentation, and it represents a genre of anti-Jewish literature that has recently attracted a fair amount of attention from Byzantinists. The adversus-Judaeos treatises in dialogue form are notoriously difficult to date, because they are literary constructions and (with one notable exception, the Doctrina Jacobi) refer to few or no historical realia, which in any case may not reflect the real date of composition. A growing consensus, however, seems to place their composition towards the end rather than the beginning of Late Antiquity. In literary terms, they thus add to the evidence for the remarkable flourishing of the dialogue as a didactic and polemical medium in the sixth and seventh centuries; in religious terms, they represent an ongoing, perhaps even growing, preoccupation with Jewish objections to the self-evident truth of Christianity. Their enduring interest lies in the nature of this preoccupation, which has been a source of disagreement among scholars since the nineteenth century. Are the dialogues authentic; if not the records of actual debates, do they at least convey the spirit and substance of a continuing debate between Jews and Christians, and of a Christian determination to overcome the anomaly of Jewish obduracy in a world that had almost completely converted to Christ? Or are they purely rhetorical constructions for the exposition of Christian theology to a Christian audience, with the aim not of converting Jews, or even communicating with them, but of strengthening Christians in their faith in a world where Judaism was no longer a real issue, but served to symbolize the real threat to Christianity posed by the advance of Islam?', 'A.

The text attributed to Synesius describes a gilding process, which is similar to those described by Pliny and Vitruvius. The commentary attributed to Olympiodorus is the only text studied here that describes something similar to a transmutation theory. It is unclear, however, if this was a theory of transmutation or if the writer meant something more like the literal meaning of the word “ekstrophē,” a term used to describe the transformation of metals, as the “turning inside-out” of what is hidden in a substance. A similar conception of ekstrophē can be found in the works of Zosimus, who discussed transmutation to make an analogy with self-purification processes, which, from the perspective of his own anthropogony, consisted in the “turning inside-out” of the “inner human” (esō anthrōpos).', 'Olivier Dufault'),

But this conception strikes against the limit on treatment. A cancer cell changed from a normal cell of a human, it does not invade from outside and harm a human like virus. A cancer cell is derived from a human cell, therefore when we aim to destroy cancer cells, this attack damages to other normal cells and weaken vital energy of a human. Here there is the limit of treatment for cancer.In opposition to these thoughts, this theory is based on the viewpoint that normal cells faced to critical situation to live and changed its system to survive under the situation and that are certainly cancer cells. The reason why a cancer cell has tough vitality to make a human death is the result to acquire the ability for existing under such a situation. Therefore a treatment for cancer is not to destroy and to kill but to remove factors that prevent normal cells from living orderly. Then cancer cells become unnecessary to derive a tough vitality. And its rapid division and multiplication will stop and return to normal cells.I built the theoretical model as follows. A cell becomes lack of oxygen that is necessary to live. Then hydrogen ions emerge in that cell. Hydrogen ions promote division and multiplication. Take these hydrogen ions out by supplying oxygen like a normal cell doing, and cancer cells will stop division and return to normal cells.This research intends to explain by facts already known and prove this model on,how hydrogen ions emerge in cells?how hydrogen ions promote cell division? Thenhow a treatment for cancer is possible?(2)The division of works of building theoretical models and experiments on biology and medical scienceSome historical discoveries on physics have walked on the process that a theoretical research predicts the existence of materials or the law and some experiments prove it. Physics is divided into two areas. One is theoretical physics that builds theoretical models and another is experimental physics that proves those models by experiments. In medical science and biology, usually one researcher builds a supposition and proves it by experiments. Theoretical work and verification by experimental work are not divided. A theoretical model without experimental proof is not enough recognized its medical or biological value.However more multiple researches will be possible by dividing theoretical work to build theoretical models and experimental work to verify it in the field of cancer that is not solved an ultimate cause and a mechanism to change from normal cells. And it should value theoretical researches that are not yet verified by experiments.This treatise is the theoretical model that is not proved by experiments. I illustrated specific ways for experiments to prove in Chapter 4, “The principle and practical methods of medical treatment for cancer of human beings, (1)Supply oxygen to cultured cancer cells, and multiplication of cancer cells will stop”.I hope that scientists of medical science and biology would prove it by experiments.', 'Nobuo Tomizawa'),

For this important new experimental discovery, the author puts forward a new understanding of positive and negative charges and finds a new theory to explain all electrostatic effects. Based on the subversive new understanding of matter, entity and heat energy, a new understanding of particle charge dynamic atomic model is initiated. It is clarified that the relationship between entity and heat energy is the root of the existence of gravitation and repulsion between matter, The law of equilibrium distance between gravity and repulsion is put forward. This paper reveals the causes of the formation of the earth\'s gravity and many phenomena of attraction and repulsion force in the universe and so on. In the fields of gravitational field, magnetic field, electric field and so on, a series of important scientific problems have been revealed! The establishment of the new theoretical system provides a new vision for solving all physical problems! The new theoretical system consists of six parts: the first part introduces the reasons for the establishment of the new theoretical system, the second part proposes a new basic epistemology of the material world, the third part is a new epistemology of the gravitational repulsion field, the fourth part is a new epistemology of the magnetic field, and the fifth part is a new epistemology of the electric field, and the sixth part expounds the scientific significance of the new theoretical system.

Spring is a fertile season for new thinking, and I wish to share new ideas. Some discussions I have had with certain medical physicists over the past several days have been especially thought‐provoking and caused me to reflect on some of the character and substance of medical physics practice. I herewith offer some personal anecdotes that resonate with my experience of medical physics education and practice along with some contemporary thoughts. My first story stems from 1966 and my 8‐grade math class. Dyke Goodin, my instructor, offered that anyone who earned a 100 average on all tests, given weekly, would earn an A+ in the class. I took him up on this challenge as I thought I only had to be careful and I could do it. In 2018, I contacted Dr. Goodin, and asked if he remembered me. I wrote: “One of your challenges to our class, so long ago, was to strive for perfection. Your standard for an A+ was daunting. Nothing less than a 100% average on all weekly tests (with no extra credit) including the final would earn it. I determined I would do it, and indeed, in the final quarter, I earned that elusive and rare A+. Let me tell you what that did for me. I had the confidence I would go as far as I could go in whatever my calling chose for me.” His response: “It might behoove you to know that you were the first student to make a 100 average without bonus points. There have been only 17 young people to accomplish this feat in my 47 years. I remember you very well. You thrived on the challenge of academic excellence. You made a 100 on my most challenging test.” My 50 (plus 1) class reunion is in June, and I hope to see Dr. Goodin in Atlanta for the first time in 54 years. In 1966, the goal to strive for perfection was unquestioned. A career in medical physics may mean over 50,000 calculations, all of them perfect or a patient may suffer injury or worse. My second anecdote (from 1973) comes from when I was working at Doctor’s Hospital in Tucker, Georgia. A gentleman having a lumbar spine exam was asking a lot of technical questions of our flustered technologist. I was a senior physics major and I volunteered to answer his questions. He asked about the grid, the bucky, the energy, the collimation, the radiation safety procedures in place, and a few other questions; I was able to satisfy him. He asked me what I planned to do, and I told him I was planning to attend the MS program in Health Physics at Georgia Tech next year. He smiled and said he would see me in class. I looked up and remembered his name: Karl Z Morgan. Some of you may recognize who he was: The Director of Health Physics at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the 1940s and 1950s, the founder of the Health Physics Society and the first Editor of the Health Physics Journal. He became my advisor for my first Master’s degree. My third story is from my PhD Advisory Committee meeting at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. My advisor was the renowned Ray Meyn, one of the world’s leading radiobiologists and ultimately the acting Chair of the Department of Experimental Radiotherapy at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. However, in 1977, he was an Assistant Professor just beginning his career and I was his student. I put together a project, which I thought was acceptable. His friend and a member of my committee was a very bright scientist whose name was Roger H_. Every student was afraid of him. After presenting my project, Dr. H_ said, “all of this is good, but what is your goal in accomplishing this project since you want to become a medical physicist?” I replied, “my goal is to do such a good job with the experiments, the writing, the conclusions and the publication of this work that it makes my supervisor, Dr. Meyn, an eminent scholar, known around the world for the value of his creative science.” Ray Meyn chipped in, “Well, now that is a goal and ambition I can wholeheartedly endorse!” Ultimately, the two articles from this project received 156 citations, according to the Web of Science. Ray told me in 2007 that this was the most cited project in his career. My final anecdote stems from when I was teaching a laboratory in radiation safety in 1979. It was about 7:30PM and the clinic was empty. I had two students, and we had access to the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) Therac 20. I set the energy for 18 MV, the jaws for 40 x 40 cm, pointed the unit at 180 degrees (straight up), and told the students to find where the beam was coming out and measure it with the survey meters I provided. After one minute, I activated the beam. After 10 minutes, they returned. The beam was exiting into a physician’s office with the center of the beam right under the chair! The office was occupied by Dr. Bill Spanos, the man who ultimately became Chair of Radiation Oncology at the University of Louisville, and the gentleman who hired me to be Chief of Physics. His message through my students was: “Thank you very much, I appreciate knowing about this.” I later found out that, at least for some of his patients, four field techniques were eliminated in favor of three field wedged techniques, removing the 180‐degree beam.', 'M.

However, previous research has shown that, as in the general population, hesitancy towards vaccines exists among HCWs as well. Previous studies further suggest that HCWs with a higher confidence in vaccinations and vaccine providers are more willing to take the vaccines themselves and to recommend vaccines to patients. In the present study with 2962 Finnish HCWs (doctors, head nurses, nurses, and practical nurses), we explored the associations between HCWs’ vaccination confidence (perceived benefit and safety of vaccines and trust in health professionals), their decisions to accept vaccines for themselves and their children, and their willingness to recommend vaccines to patients. The results showed that although the majority of HCWs had high confidence in vaccinations, a notable share reported low vaccination confidence. Moreover, in line with previous research, HCWs with higher confidence in the benefits and safety of vaccines were more likely to accept vaccines for their children and themselves, and to recommend vaccines to their patients. Trust in other health professionals was not directly related to vaccination or recommendation behavior. Confidence in the benefits and safety of vaccines was highest among doctors, and increased along with the educational level of the HCWs, suggesting a link between confidence and the degree of medical training.

In this study we examined whether prior vaccination with whole-cell pertussis vaccine (wP) at any point provided superior protection contrasted with a solely acellular pertussis vaccine (aP) series. We utilized the coincidence of a large outbreak of pertussis with the termination of wP availability, providing populations of children who had been vaccinated with combinations of wP and aP.\n\n\nMETHODS\nKaiser Permanente (KP) is an integrated healthcare system with complete electronic records and a centralized laboratory. Cases of laboratory-confirmed pertussis and vaccination data for members aged 8-20 years were retrieved.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 263 496 persons aged 8-20 years, 904 cases of pertussis were identified. In patients with a full history of vaccinations administered by KP, those with 5 total doses of only aP had an 8.57 relative risk (RR) of pertussis (P < .0001) contrasted to those with ≥1 wP dose. With 6 doses of aP, the RR of disease was 3.55 (P < .0001). When external vaccine records were included, the results were similar.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found a markedly increased risk of disease associated with an entirely aP series. This risk was mitigated, but not eliminated, by the presence of a sixth dose of pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Receipt of 1 or more wP doses markedly augmented the durability of immunity from subsequent aP doses. It appears that a wholly acellular pertussis vaccine series is significantly less effective and durable than one that contains the traditional whole cell vaccine.', 'M. Witt, Larry Arias, Paul H.

In this follow up study conducted about 4 years later, the 60-64 year olds initially given PCV13 received PCV13 or PPSV23, and those initially given PPSV23 received another PPSV23.

Vaccinations have reduced disease, disability, and death from a variety of infectious diseases. For example, in the United States, children are recommended to be vaccinated against 16 diseases (1). Table 1 highlights the impact in the United States of immunization against nine vaccine-preventable diseases, including smallpox and a complication of one of those diseases, congenital rubella syndrome, showing representative annual numbers of cases in the 20th century compared with 2016 reported cases (2, 3). All of the diseases have been reduced by more than 90% and many have either been eliminated or reductions of 99% or more have been achieved. A recent analysis of vaccines to protect against 13 diseases estimated that for a single birth cohort nearly 20 million cases of diseases were prevented, including over 40,000 deaths (4). In addition to saving the lives of our children, vaccination has resulted in net economic benefits to society amounting to almost $69 billion in the United States alone. A recent economic analysis of 10 vaccines for 94 low- and middle-income countries estimated that an investment of $34 billion for the immunization programs resulted in savings of $586 billion in reducing costs of illness and $1.53 trillion when broader economic benefits were included (5).

Most traditional vaccine providers (eg, physician offices) administer vaccinations during standard clinic hours, but community pharmacies offer expanded hours that allow patients to be vaccinated at convenient times. We analyzed the types of vaccines administered and patient populations vaccinated during off-clinic hours in a national community pharmacy, and their implications for vaccination access and convenience. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data for all vaccinations given at the Walgreens pharmacy chain between August 2011 and July 2012. The time of vaccination was categorized as occurring during traditional hours (9:00 am–6:00 pm weekdays) or off-clinic hours, consisting of weekday evenings, weekends, and federal holidays. We compared demographic characteristics and types of vaccine. We used a logistic regression model to identify predictors of being vaccinated during off-clinic hours. RESULTS During the study period, pharmacists administered 6,250,402 vaccinations, of which 30.5% were provided during off-clinic hours: 17.4% were provided on weekends, 10.2% on evenings, and 2.9% on holidays. Patients had significantly higher odds of off-clinic vaccination if they were younger than 65 years of age, were male, resided in an urban area, and did not have any chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS A large proportion of adults being vaccinated receive their vaccines during evening, weekend, and holiday hours at the pharmacy, when traditional vaccine providers are likely unavailable. Younger, working-aged, healthy adults, in particular, accessed a variety of immunizations during off-clinic hours. With the low rates of adult and adolescent vaccination in the United States, community pharmacies are creating new opportunities for vaccination that expand access and convenience.', 'J. Goad, M.

The purpose of the present work was to assess the duration of immunity in dogs that is attainable with a commercial inactivated bivalent leptospirosis vaccine. For this purpose, young dogs were vaccinated twice followed by challenge with either Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola or L. interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae 5 weeks, 27 weeks or 56 weeks after the second vaccination. For assessment of the duration of immunity, titres of agglutinating serum antibodies were measured before and after challenge, and the effects of challenge on a variety of parameters were determined including reisolation of challenge organisms from blood, urine and kidney. Both challenge strains induced a generalised infection in control dogs, the canicola strain being most virulent. From the results with different parameters it appeared that the two vaccinations induced a high rate of protection from generalised infection with canicola and icterohaemorrhagiae at 5, 27 and 56 weeks after the second vaccination. In addition, after 56 weeks, still a high level of immunity against renal infection with sv. canicola and, as a consequence, urinary shedding of sv. canicola bacteria, was demonstrated.

However, antibody levels in infants induced by both types of pertussis vaccines wane already after 1 year. Therefore, long-term T-cell responses upon vaccination might play a role in protection against pertussis. In a cross-sectional study (ISRCTN65428640), we investigated T-helper (Th) cell immune responses in wP- or aP-vaccinated children before and after an aP low-dose or high-dose preschool booster at 4 years of age in The Netherlands. T cells were stimulated with pertussis vaccine antigens. The numbers of gamma interferon-producing cells and Th1, Th2, Th17, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokine concentrations were determined. In addition, pertussis-specific IgE levels were measured in plasma. Children being vaccinated with aP vaccinations at 2, 3, 4, and 11 months of age still showed higher pertussis-specific T-cell responses at 4 years of age than did wP-vaccinated children. These T-cell responses failed to show a typical increase in cytokine production after a fifth aP vaccination but remained high after a low-dose booster and seemed to decline even after a high-dose booster. Importantly, elevated IgE levels were induced after this booster vaccination. In contrast, wP-vaccinated children had only low prebooster T-cell responses, and these children showed a clear postbooster T-cell memory response even after a low-dose booster vaccine. Four high-dose aP vaccinations in infancy induce high T-cell responses still present even 3 years after vaccination and enhanced IgE responses after preschool booster vaccination. Therefore, studies of changes in vaccine dosage, timing of pertussis (booster) vaccinations, and the possible association with local side effects are necessary.', 'R. Schure, L. Hendrikx, L.

It is also described after vaccination, like MMR and varicella zoster virus (VZV). We will establish incidence rates of (varicella related) ACA and assess the attributable risk of vaccination to ACA in the Netherlands.\n\n\nMETHOD\nData on ACA in children, following infections, like varicella, and vaccinations, obtained from prospective, active pediatric surveillance and passive surveillance on adverse events following immunizations (AEFI) were compared with hospitalization data for ataxia. Capture-recapture (CRC) method was used to estimate the burden of ACA in the Netherlands.\n\n\nRESULTS\n45 children with ACA were included (44 and 1 reported by pediatric and AEFI surveillance respectively, 30 were hospitalized). Chickenpox preceded ACA in 15 cases, one case followed MMR. Of the hospitalization reports, 13 fulfilled the criteria for ACA. Using CRC the estimated number of hospitalized ACA cases was 42. For varicella related ACA, this estimate was 10, resulting in an incidence rate of 0.7:100,000 (95%CI 0.52-0.94, all cases) and 0.17:100,000 (95%CI 0.09-0.31, varicella related cases) for children under 15 years of age.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe incidence rates were comparable with other studies. We found no association with MMR, but chickenpox was clearly related to ACA. According to age-specific seroprevalence data the incidence rate of ACA was 5:100,000 VZV infections for children up to 5 years, compared to an ACA-reporting rate of 0.15:100,000 doses VZV-vaccine. Therefore, uptake of VZV-vaccine in the immunization programme will diminish the incidence rate of ACA.', 'N. V. D. van der Maas, P. E. V. Bondt, H. D. de Melker, J. Kemmeren'),

Main objectives of the cross-sectional study conducted were to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding vaccination issues, to estimate the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination counseling on community advocacy in a sample of general population. An anonymous validated questionnaire was administered in April 2017 at the main shopping center of Palermo and was followed by tailored vaccination counseling interventions. To estimate the effectiveness of the interventions four main connection parameters to the vaccinarsi.org website were evaluated, in the two months before and after the intervention and in the two months before the intervention compared with the same period of previous and following years. Among the 299 subject enrolled 12.7% were hesitant about vaccinations, and 4.7% declared being against vaccinations. General practitioners (GPs) and pediatricians were the most affordable source of information about vaccinations. A higher probability of vaccination hesitancy/refusal was reported among subjects who considered “alternative strategies” the best way for the prevention of infectious diseases (adj-OR = 7.01, IC95% 2.88–17.09, p-value < 0.001). A considerable increase of all the vaccinarsi.org website indicators analyzed was observed, from the area in which survey participants lived. Prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among population surveyed is consistent with the literature data. HCWs, such as GPs and pediatricians, should play a key role in modifying personal convictions and choices about vaccinations.

Thus, it is hardly surprising that the academic research of corruption is growing as well. While some authors focus on explaining corrupt behaviour (e.g. Tavits 2010), others investigate the effects corruption has on economy (Uslaner 2007), society (della Porta 2000; Pharr 2000) or politics (Mishler& Rose 2005). Considerable amount of research is also devoted to the relationship between the corruption and trust (Anderson and Tverdova 2003; Chang & Chu 2006; HakhverdianM Dalton 2004; Chang & Chu 2006, Hakhverdian & Mayne 2012; Wroe, Allen & Birch 2013; etc.) we have not found any similar research that would narrow down the institutional trust in this particular way. Therefore we believe that focusing on this specific type of trust presents a contribution to current research on corruption. Another contribution of this paper is that we not only separate the corruption perception from experience, but also disentangle the previously suggested reverse causation between the corruption perception and trust (della Porta 2000; Wroe et al. 2013). There is a debate in the academic literature, whether it is the trust that influences the corruption perception, or vice versa (Wroe et al. 2013). This paper uses structural equation models to disentangle the two causal paths. Four Eastern European countries are compared in this research. We have chosen Estonia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania to investigate and compare the causal mechanisms operating between corruption experience, perception and anticorruption trust. The selected countries have different cultures, as demonstrated by different positions in various rankings comparing corruption. We decided to choose four countries that are different enough in order to also see the differences in the causal mechanisms under investigation. Since the Baltic countries are often considered to be relatively homogeneous, we chose one case representing the region. The same applies to the Visegrad group of countries, out of which we chose Slovakia. Slovenia is in many aspects one of the kind and therefore we included it in the analysis as well. Romania is representing the Balkan region. A more detailed discussion of the country selection can be found in the methodology part of this paper. This study makes use of the Eurobarometer micro-data that is not so frequently used. However, it provides several items on corruption and thus allows us separating the three dimensions. As mentioned, we apply structural equation modelling techniques to estimate the direct and indirect effects as well as the reverse causal relationships. The structure of the paper is as follows: after the introduction, we review the theories linking corruption and trust. In the following section we discuss the distinction between the corruption perception and corruption experience. Subsequently we define our variables and describe data and method in a more detailed way and discuss the instrumental variables employed in the model. What follows is the empirical analysis and presentation of the results. Before concluding, we discuss the main contribution of this study as well as the limitations encountered. …', 'P. Babos'),

IN demarcating the set of salient controversies in American politics that should be called  social issues,  scholars have cast a wide net and employed varying labels. In this chapter, I consider the characteristics that social issues have in common and their implications for public opinion. I then turn to empirical efforts to delineate the set of political debates that should be called social issues, paying special attention to efforts made to cast opinion on these issues as a second dimension of political conflict that is separate from the primary axis of debate over economic policies in the United States. The chapter proceeds by examining broad trends in opinion on social issues and considering how media coverage of these issues has changed with public opinion. It then discusses three explanations regarding the sources of attitudes on social issues—authoritarianism, core values, and elite opinion leadership—and considers the strengths of these explanations, the extent to which they suggest that the etiology of public opinion on social issues is particularly unusual or distinctive from that of other issues, and the research frontier on these questions. What is a  Social Issue  ? There can be a fair amount of disagreement among scholars about just what should be considered a social issue, but at the core of most typologies are those controversies that fall under the aegis of  religious and cultural conflict  (Layman 2001): issues such as end p.622 abortion, gay rights, the role of religion in public schools, and euthanasia. Other scholars also include additional battles over freedom of speech and the public regulation of private behavior—such as use of recreational drugs and the availability of pornography—on a longer register of what they call  moral issues  (for example, Ansolabehere, Rodden, and Snyder 2008). An even further expansion of the list is promoted by those who locate the origins of opinion in the extent of one\'s predisposition toward authoritarianism, which they view as a cause of what one scholar calls the  familiar triad of racial, political and moral intolerance  (Stenner 2005: 1).

Using social media may make the recruitment process more efficient. Merely 20% of clinical trials are completed on time, a finding mostly linked to challenges in patient recruitment [1]. Recruitment through social media is increasingly being recognized as a tool to efficiently identify eligible subjects at lower costs [2, 3]. One of the key reasons for its success is the strong adherence of users to specific social media platforms. Facebook for instance has over 2.38 billion active monthly users of which about 75% access the network on a daily basis [4]. As such, the platform and other like it offer great potential to quickly and affordably enroll patients into clinical trials and surveys [3, 5-7].\nAt present, little evidence is available on the efficacy of using social media to recruit patients into cardiovascular and hypertension trials [8]. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of social media as an approach to recruit hypertensive patients into the RADIANCE-HTN SOLO trial.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of social media as an approach to recruit hypertensive patients into the RADIANCE-HTN SOLO trial.\n \n \n METHODS\n The RADIANCE-HTN SOLO (NCT02649426) is a multicenter, randomised study that was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of endovascular ultrasound renal denervation (RDN) to reduce ambulatory blood pressure at 2 months in patients with combined systolic–diastolic hypertension in the absence of medications. \nBetween March 28, 2016, and Dec 28, 2017, 803 patients were screened for eligibility and 146 were randomised to undergo RDN (n=74) or a sham procedure (n=72) [9]. Key entry criteria included: age 18-75 years with essential hypertension using 0-2 antihypertensive drugs. Patients were recruited from 21 hospitals in the USA and 18 hospitals in Europe. \nThe study was approved by local ethics committees or institutional review boards and was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent. All recruitment materials including social media campaigns was approved by local ethics committees of the involved sites. \nRecruitment strategies included social media (Facebook), conventional advertisements (ads) (magazine, brochure/poster, radio, newspaper), web search (the clinical website, craigslist and web-browsing), and physician referral. \nBoth newspaper ads and posters contained brief information about study entry criteria. Newspapers were distributed at public transport places and posters were displayed in outpatient cardiology and hypertension clinics. \nRadio ads were run for 30 or 60 seconds providing a short summary of the study, entry criteria and contact information. Ads were run in major metropolitan areas on radio stations with large adult listener bases during popular days and times.\nFacebook ads were targeted towards subjects >45 years old within a certain distance from a recruitment site (range 20-50 miles). Criteria were modified over time in order to increase response rates [i.e. distance was increased or decreased, age was increased to >55 year]. Facebook ads referred to a dedicated study website translated into country specific languages. If interested, subjects could complete an anonymous online screening questionnaire which provided direct automatic feedback on study eligibility. Eligible subjects were asked to provide contact details (name and telephone number) to receive additional information, a process coordinated via a secure online portal (Galen Gateway Patient Recruitment Portal, Galen Patient Recruitment, Inc., Cumberland, RI). Study site were only able to contact potential candidates within their area.

However, these are two different analytical categories. Thus I separate these notions in this dissertation and refer to social trust as trust between people and political trust as trust in political institutions. Compared to social trust, political trust rests on a vague and partial understanding (Giddens, 1990: 179), because the relationship between truster (individual) and trustee (institution, politician) is not direct or equal. Political trust can be learned through primary contact (personal experience with the institutions), but as Newton (2001: 205) observes, it is usually learned indirectly and at a distance – through media. Indeed, media play a crucial role in establishing pillars of political trust, providing us with information to make judgments about politicians and institutions. We may not know the people in government personally, but we believe that we have sufficient information to make expectations and judgments about them. Unlike some forms of social trust, political trust is always related to expectations, so in this sense it is a strategic, but not moralistic trust (Uslaner, 2002). Conceptualized in this manner, political trust applies to actions of some institution or politician being in line with my normative expectations, even if I do not check these actions permanently. Therefore, political trust is sometimes understood as a psychological orientation, having both affective and evaluative aspects (Norris, 1999). There is a rich literature discussing the dialectics of political trust and liberal democracy, and I would like to make a brief detour into that to argue how social and political trust are related (and I find this philosophical literature helpful in this regard). To begin with, in liberal political thinking, trust is a fairly controversial notion (Warren, 1999; Hardin, 2006; Rosanvallon, 2008). Although sociological theories consider political trust and democracy as mutually supportive, according to liberal philosophy, the roots of the liberal system lie, in fact, in distrust. The French philosopher Pierre Rosanvallon (2008) maintains that distrust is a natural and legitimate component of democracy, and it functions as a protective mechanism, enabling society to control the democratic processes alongside the formal rules. Following the thought of liberal philosophy, distrust is a necessary condition for institutions not to override their authority or abuse the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens. Historically, the institutionalisation of distrust in the political system was tightly related to economic liberalism. The Constitution of the United States (1787) has primarily anchored the legal mechanisms of distrust in 13 Some authors think that, when we talk about institutions and systems, the term trust is inappropriate and should be replaced with more neutral terms such as reliance or confidence (for instance, Dalton, 1999; Sapsford and Abbott, 2006). On the other hand, the term political trust is also widely used and discussed (Mishler and Rose 2001, Newton, 2007; Van der Meer, 2010). the realm of economics: it inscribes protective mechanisms on behalf of economic liberties against the intervention of the state in economic relations. These mechanisms have been transferred to the more abstract sphere of politics, first of all, by means of the “division of powers”, allowing institutions to compete with each other for power and thus restraining each other’s possibilities for systemic usurpation. Moreover, distrust is also institutionalized through additional “safeguards”: a multi-party system, election rules, the right to competition, monitoring, and formalities that regulate the time span and periodicity of office terms (Benn and Peters, 1959: 281). However, the constitutional rules and formal safeguard mechanisms alone are not sufficient to avoid the abuse of power by institutions. Democracy also encompasses a wide range of resistance forms that could be used by society against the government, and these forms surpass the limits of formal rules (Warren 1999; Rosanvallon, 2008). People are not only just voters (passive participants), but also active quality controllers (critical citizens) of the political system. The philosopher refers to this kind of interaction, when citizens maintain the control levers through protest, as “counter democracy” (Rosanvallon, 2008). Permanent distrust in the political system exerted by the people is arguably one of the fundamental substantial ideas for democracy to truly work. Braithwaite and Levi (1998) label the democratic project as “institutionalized distrust”. Hardin (2006: 152) acknowledges that distrust is one of the key conditions for modern democracy. Power inequality between state institutions and common people is too immoderate (unbalanced), but we have no alternatives to these institutions. We are dependent on them. Institutionalized distrust implicates institutional accountancy so called “agencies of accountability” that may enforce trustworthiness of the system. These agencies (courts, police, controllers, examination boards, media, etc.) put pressure on persons, institutions, or systems that are our targets of trust (Sztompka, 1999: 47). Yet enforcement agencies must be trustworthy themselves. If citizens do not trust these agencies, they will not trust their officials to fulfill their duties (Dasgupta, 1988: 50). It should be clarified that institutionalized political distrust (substantial distrust) is not the same as political distrust in concrete political institutions (formal distrust). To avoid confusion, it is expedient to differentiate between these two forms of political distrust. Formal political (dis)trust would be expressed towards, for instance, the parliament, the government, or concrete politicians. Substantial political distrust refers to the permanent distrust (or “healthy” suspicion) of institutional politics or of the system as such. Hence, in liberal thinking, political participation – voting, writing petitions, demonstrations, and boycotts – is the expression of substantial political distrust. We participate in elections in order to control the powers of institutions and express our substantial distrust in them. Thus, exposing substantial political distrust does not imply that we also feel formal political distrust at the same time. Chapter 2 48 |', 'T. Gaidytė');

This study proposes that the disparities in how society treats Black drug users are in part due to the way people’s perception of drug users differs based on the race of the target. In addition, this study sought to examine how these perceptions are predicted by implicit and explicit racial prejudice. To test these research questions, college students (n = 99) were randomly assigned to view an electronic court case record of a White or Black drug user or a drug user of an unspecified race, and asked to make judgments about them; explicit and implicit bias towards Blacks was measured. Results revealed that the higher the levels of explicit prejudice towards Black drug users and drug users of an unspecified race, the more they are associated with negative stereotypical traits and the more people predict them to be able to commit more serious crimes in the future, compared to White drug users. We also found that people perceived that Black drug users would be less successful in the future compared to drug users of an unspecified race if provided with health treatment. Gaining a better understanding of the underlying reasons behind racial disparities in the criminal justice system is important to instigate reforms to the system and to the quality of health care offered to drug users of different races. EFFECT OF RACIAL PREJUDICE ON PERCEPTIONS OF DRUG USERS 4 Effect of Explicit and Implicit Prejudice on Perceptions of Drug Users of Different Races Racial disparities in incarceration rates have plagued the United States for decades. According to “The Impact of Crack Cocaine on Black America” (Hendricks & Wilson, 2013), 85% of crack cocaine users who were incarcerated during the American crack epidemic between 1984 and the early 1990s were Black. Although today’s heroin epidemic is mostly perpetuated by the suburban, White, middle-class population (Cicero, Ellis, Surratt, & Kurtz, 2014), according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, Blacks still make up more than 50% of drug users who get arrested. Simultaneously, more programs have been designed to reduce the imprisonment of White drug users, to encourage police officers to direct them to social workers instead of immediately putting them in jail and to provide easier access to medical attention and treatment. In contrast, Black drug users typically get less assistance for life-threatening medical issues (Netherland & Hansen, 2016). The purpose of the current study is to explore differences in perceptions of Black and White drug users, and whether these perceptions are affected by implicit and explicit prejudice. This is imperative to help us understand the causes behind disparities in health treatment and the likelihood of incarceration between Black and White drug users. There are disparities in the comprehensive health treatment offered to racial minorities compared to that offered to Whites. This is often associated with the health facilities that are available to racial minorities and on the cultural sensitivity of the health programs. A recent study by Acevedo and colleagues (2015) studied the health treatments offered to Whites and to minorities. The treatment can consist of inpatient admissions, outpatient rehabilitation, or programs that offer partial hospitalization. Of particular interest is patients’ likelihood of treatment engagement, which refers to the provision of more services within a month of being on EFFECT OF RACIAL PREJUDICE ON PERCEPTIONS OF DRUG USERS 5 medical treatment. More treatment engagement was connected to a lower probability of abusing drugs afterwards and of getting arrested. The researchers observed the start of treatment, treatment engagement, and incarceration rates based on race in samples of adult patients grouped by state (Acevedo et al., 2015). They reported that in most states, Blacks tended to have lower treatment initiation and treatment engagement rates compared to Whites. Even though it was not consistent across all the states they examined, they also found that in a few of those states, patients who experienced treatment engagement had lower arrest rates afterwards. Not only could the health of minorities be ameliorated if they were provided with better support and health resources, but having better health care options could also limit the harsh effects of the criminal justice system. There are also racial disparities in whether drug users are determined as eligible to receive health treatment in lieu of incarceration. Black drug users are more prone to incarceration compared to White drug users even though both races use drugs at similar rates (Nicosia, MacDonald, & Pacula, 2017). When it comes to drug sentences, this disparity has serious consequences on the lives of imprisoned Blacks. Being incarcerated leads to the loss of various rights such as the ability to vote or to receive aid in the form of welfare programs, veteran advantages, and food stamps (Olson, 2016). They may also struggle to find a well-paid job after being released from prison, which makes it virtually impossible to obtain proper health care. As a result of these disparities, the system promotes a vicious cycle that is unfair and deleterious to the Black population. One reason for the difference in the treatment between Blacks and Whites may be the dichotomy in cultural stereotypes between the two groups. Activation of these cultural stereotypes is contingent on the visual cues that perceivers use to associate individuals with EFFECT OF RACIAL PREJUDICE ON PERCEPTIONS OF DRUG USERS 6 particular social categories such as race, gender, or age. This process is termed social categorization (Bartholow & Dickter, 2008). People use social categorization in order to reduce the cognitive load associated with individuating others, or distinguishing every individual with whom they interact. By grouping individuals together by their social group, perceivers are able to simplify the task of forming their perception of each individual, and avoid having to understand each one, separately. The salience of a certain categorization can dominate how perceivers choose to form their impression (Macrae, Bodenhausen, & Milne, 1995). Furthermore, the perceivers’ own goals and how prejudiced they are towards different social groups can also play an influential role in social categorization. These ways of categorizing people allows perceivers to form an impression of the target quickly and conveniently. However, they can simultaneously cause stereotype activation, which in turn, leads to biased judgments about the target that are not based on his or her own unique characteristics (Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000). Due in part to the frequent distorted portrayal of Blacks in the media, Blacks are often perceived as more violent, impulsive, and menacing than Whites, and are often unfairly stereotyped as criminals and drug users (Najdowski, Goff, & Bottoms, 2015; Welch, 2004). These stereotypes lead people to make unreliable predictions concerning the traits and behaviors of Black individuals and instigate the formation of negative impressions about Black drug users (Kunda & Thagard, 1996). Accordingly, crimes that Blacks commit tend to be perceived as more abhorrent than if those same crimes were committed by Whites, and “unlike progressive trends in other racial attitudes, associations between race and crime have changed little in recent years” (Duncan, 1976; Pager, 2008, p. 3). When Black people commit a crime, people have the tendency to believe that it is due to them being supposedly inferior, whereas when White people commit a EFFECT OF RACIAL PREJUDICE ON PERCEPTIONS OF DRUG USERS 7 crime, people tend to blame it on environmental circumstances such as being under the poverty line (Olson, 2016). Additionally, since Blacks are incarcerated more frequently than other races, they are often targeted as the main source of the U.S.’s drug problem and are more likely to be associated with drug use and crimes in general, by the public (Welch, 2007). Welch (2007) reported that local media sources often depict Blacks in more threatening situations than Whites, which makes the public grow more wary of Black criminal suspects than White criminal suspects. To investigate whether the punishment of inmates in prison was related to race and whether this was due to negative stereotypes that prison guards have about Black inmates being more violent, confrontational, and criminal, Olson (2016) looked specifically at how likely Black inmates were to be put in solitary confinement, which is one of the harshest types of punishments enforced in prisons, compared to inmates of other races. They found that there is a racial bias against Black inmates and that they have a 31.6% chance of being subjected to solitary confinement compared to White inmates, who have a 25.6% chance (Olson, 2016). Being forced into solitary confinement, in turn, eventually leads to higher rates of recidivism, or inclination to commit a crime again, among Black inmates. This perpetuates the cycle by causing them to be more prone to get arrested and, then once in jail, they become more likely to undergo harsh punishment that encourages even more criminal actions. Race-based judgments have a profound impact on the treatment of Black and White drug users and on the level of sympathy and understanding that they each receive (Jussim, Eccles, & Madon, 1995). Even though Whites are increasingly using illegal drugs, the public still has the tendency to picture drug users as people from Black populations in inner-city neighborhoods that deal cocaine and crack (Gaston, 2016). Furthermore, they also perceive Black drug users more EFFECT OF RACIAL PREJUDICE ON PERCEPTIONS OF DRUG USERS 8 negatively than Whites due to more Blacks mov', 'M. ScholarWorks'),

The condition affects nearly six percent of the population of the United States.

However, recent studies have shown that poorly differentiated tumors are more accurately classified by immunohistochemistry. In this study, we investigated the use of immunohistochemical analysis in reclassifying lung carcinomas that were originally diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma. Tumor slides and blocks were available for histologic evaluation, and tissue microarrays were constructed from 480 patients with resected lung carcinomas originally diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma between 1999 and 2009. Immunohistochemical analyses for p40, p63, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1; clones SPT24 and 8G7G3/1), napsin A, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56 were performed. Staining intensity (weak, moderate, or strong) and distribution (focal or diffuse) were also recorded. Of all, 449 (93.5%) patients were confirmed as having squamous cell carcinomas; the cases were mostly diffusely positive for p40 and negative for TTF-1 (8G7G3/1). Twenty cases (4.2%) were reclassified as adenocarcinoma, as they were positive for TTF-1 (8G7G3/1 or SPT24) with either no or focal p40 expression, and all of them were poorly differentiated with squamoid morphology.

Six environmental impacts were assessed in this study: global warming potential (GWP); acidification potential (AP); eutrophication potential (EP); ozone depletion potential (ODP); photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP); and abiotic depletion potential (ADP). The results show that diesel engine remanufacturing could reduce 66% of energy consumption, compared to original manufacturing.

The relic number density of the dark matter is determined by the dark matter asymmetry generated through the same mechanism as leptogenesis when the dark matter was the Dirac fermion. After efficient dark matter annihilation processes have frozen out, a phase transition of a scalar field takes place and generates Majorana mass terms to turn the dark matter particle into the Majorana fermion. In order to address this scenario in detail, we propose two simple models. The first one is based on the Standard Model (SM) gauge group and the dark matter originates the $SU(2)_L$ doublet Dirac fermion, analogous to the Higgsino-like neutralino in supersymmetric models. We estimate the spin-independent/dependent elastic scattering cross sections of this late-time Majorana dark matter with a proton and find the possibility to discover it by the direct and/or indirect dark matter search experiments in the near future. The second model is based on the $B-L$ gauged extension of the SM, where the dark matter is a SM singlet. Although this model is similar to the so-called Higgs portal dark matter scenario, the spin-independent elastic scattering cross section can be large enough to detect this dark matter in future experiments.', 'N.

Ivermectin is known to be a potent inhibitor of importin α/β-mediated nuclear transport and exhibits antiviral activity towards several RNA viruses by blocking the nuclear trafficking of viral proteins. Although PRRSV replication occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells, the nucleocapsid (N) protein has been shown to distinctly localize in the nucleus and nucleolus throughout infection. Here, we sought to assess whether ivermectin suppresses PRRSV replication in cultured porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM) cells and to investigate the effect of ivermectin on the subcellular localization of the PRRSV N protein. Our data demonstrate that ivermectin treatment inhibits PRRSV infection in PAM-pCD163 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral activity of ivermectin on PRRSV replication was most effective when cells were treated during the early stage of infection. Treatment of PRRSV-infected cells with ivermectin significantly suppressed viral RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny virus production. However, immunofluorescence and cell fractionation assays revealed that ivermectin was incapable of disrupting the nuclear localization of the N protein, both in PRRSV-infected PAM-pCD163 cells and in PAM cells stably expressing the PRRSV N protein. This finding suggests that an alternative mechanism of action accounts for the ability of ivermectin to diminish PRRSV replication.

However, there is no directly effective antiviral drug application against respiratory viral pathogens; generally, the metaphylactic antibacterial drug applications are used for BRD.

Moreover, since it is identified as an inhibitor for importin α/β-mediated nuclear localization signal (NLS), IVM is also reported to have antiviral potential against several RNA and DNA viruses. Since therapeutic use of IVM in COVID-19 cases has recently been postulated, the potential antiviral activity against bovine respiratory viruses including BRSV, BPIV-3, BoHV-1, BCoV and BVDV are evaluated in this study. For these purposes, virus titration assay was used to evaluate titers in viral harvest from infected cells treated with non-cytotoxic IVM concentrations (1, 2.5 and 5 μM) and compared to titers from non-treated infected cells. This study indicated that IVM inhibits the replication of BCoV, BVDV, BRSV and BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro as well as number of extracellular infectious virions, but it has no importantly strong antiviral effect against extracellular shedding of BPIV-3. In addition, it was demonstrated that IVM has no clear effect on the attachment and penetration steps of the replication of the studied viruses. Finally, this study shows for the first time that IVM can inhibit infection of BRD-related viral agents namely BCoV, BVDV, BRSV and BoHV-1 at the concentrations of 2.5 and 5 μM.

Previous work showed that VHSV sub-genotype IVb suppresses host innate immune responses, but the exact mechanism by which VHSV IVb inhibits antiviral response remains incompletely characterized. As with other novirhabdoviruses, VHSV IVb contains a unique and highly variable nonvirion (NV) gene, which is implicated in viral replication, virus-induced apoptosis and regulating interferon (IFN) production. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of IVb NV gene in regulating viral or cellular processes is poorly understood. Compared to the wild-type recombinant (rWT) VHSV, mutant VHSV lacking a functional IVb NV reduced IFN expression and compromised innate immune response of the host cells by inhibiting translation. VHSV IVb infection increased phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α), resulting in host translation shutoff. However, VHSV IVb protein synthesis proceeds despite increasing phosphorylation of eIF2α. During VHSV IVb infection, eIF2α phosphorylation was mediated via PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and was required for efficient viral protein synthesis, but shutoff of host translation and IFN signaling was independent of p-eIF2α. Similarly, IVb NV null VHSV infection induced less p-eIF2α, but exhibited decreased viral protein synthesis despite increased levels of viral mRNA. These findings show a role for IVb NV in VHSV pathogenesis by utilizing the PERK-eIF2α pathway for viral-mediated host shutoff and interferon signaling to regulate host cell response.', 'Shelby Powell Kesterson, Jeffery L.

As the search for effective antiviral agents continues, we aimed to review data on the potential of repurposing antiparasitic drugs against viruses in general, with an emphasis on coronaviruses. Methods We performed a review by screening in vitro and in vivo studies that assessed the antiviral activity of several antiparasitic agents: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), mefloquine, artemisinins, ivermectin, nitazoxanide (NTZ), niclosamide, atovaquone and albendazole. Results For HCQ and chloroquine we found ample in vitro evidence of antiviral activity. Cohort studies that assessed the use of HCQ for COVID-19 reported conflicting results, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated no effect on mortality rates and no substantial clinical benefits of HCQ used either for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. We found two clinical studies of artemisinins and two studies of NTZ for treatment of viruses other than COVID-19, all of which showed mixed results. Ivermectin was evaluated in one RCT and few observational studies, demonstrating conflicting results. As the level of evidence of these data is low, the efficacy of ivermectin against COVID-19 remains to be proven. For chloroquine, HCQ, mefloquine, artemisinins, ivermectin, NTZ and niclosamide, we found in vitro studies showing some effects against a wide array of viruses. We found no relevant studies for atovaquone and albendazole. Conclusions As the search for an effective drug active against SARS-CoV-2 continues, we argue that pre-clinical research of possible antiviral effects of compounds that could have antiviral activity should be conducted. Clinical studies should be conducted when sufficient in vitro evidence exists, and drugs should be introduced into widespread clinical use only after being rigorously tested in RCTs. Such a search may prove beneficial in this pandemic or in outbreaks yet to come.', 'S. Rakedzon, A. Neuberger, A. Domb, N. Petersiel, Eli Schwartz'),

Here, we studied the effect of ORF3 deletion on the proliferation of PEDV in Vero cells. To this end, four recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were rescued using targeted RNA recombination, three carrying the full-length ORF3 gene from different PEDV strains, and one from which the ORF3 gene had been deleted entirely. Our results showed that PEDVs with intact or naturally truncated ORF3 replicated to significantly higher titers than PEDV without an ORF3. Further characterization revealed that the extent of apoptosis induced by PEDV infection was significantly lower with the viruses carrying an intact or C-terminally truncated ORF3 than with the virus lacking ORF3, indicating that the ORF3 protein as well as its truncated form interfered with the apoptosis process.

Here, we study the effect of defective interfering (DI) particle (DIP) co-infection on cell-to-cell variability in influenza A virus (IAV) replication. DIPs contain a large internal deletion in one of their eight viral RNAs (vRNA) and are, thus, defective in virus replication. Moreover, they interfere with virus replication. Using single-cell isolation and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we uncovered a large between-cell heterogeneity in the DI vRNA content of infected cells, which was confirmed for DI mRNAs by single-cell RNA sequencing. A high load of intracellular DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs was found in low-productive cells, indicating their contribution to the large cell-to-cell variability in virus release. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of host cell mRNA expression (some factors may inhibit virus replication), but not the ribosome content, may further affect the strength of single-cell virus replication. Finally, we show that the load of viral mRNAs (facilitating viral protein production) and the DI mRNA content are, independently from one another, connected with single-cell virus production.

Already many molecular mechanisms of innate immune evasion by +ssRNA viruses have been identified. However, research addressing the effect of host innate immune evasion on the pathology caused by viral infections is less prevalent in the literature, though very relevant and interesting. Since interferons have been implicated in inflammatory diseases and immunopathology in addition to their protective role in infection, antagonizing the immune response may have an ambiguous effect on the clinical outcome of the viral disease.

Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit ZIKV, such as IFITM3, have been identified largely using overexpression studies. Here, we tested whether diverse ZIKV strains differed in their susceptibility to IFN-I-mediated restriction and the contribution of IFITM3 to this restriction. We identified a robust IFN-I-mediated antiviral effect on ZIKV replication (>100-fold reduction) in A549 cells, a commonly used cell line to study ZIKV replication.

Viruses from the American pathogenic outbreak were more sensitive to IFNα (p = 0.049) and IFNβ (p = 0.09) than African-lineage strains, which have not been linked to severe pathogenesis.

But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries.

The aim of this study is to assess the opinions of primary health care professionals on the vaccine against HPV and their knowledge about HPV infection and its links to with gynecological and oropharyngeal cancer.MethodsCross-sectional study. A 19-item survey was drawn up. It included questions on basic aspects of HPV infection and marketed vaccines, personal opinion about the inclusion in the immunization schedules and their level of prescription and recommendation to patients in their clinical practice. From October 2013 to December 2013, 607 surveys were distributed among 20 primary health centers affiliated to the University Hospital 12 de Octubre.

Animal size, age, breed, sampling time and vaccine had significant effects on pass rates and median titres. Our data suggests that a general relationship between animal size and level of antibody response exists and smaller sized dogs elicited higher antibody levels than larger breeds of dog. It was not however, only the magnitude of response immediately following vaccination but also the duration of immunity that varied between breeds of dog. Another observation was that young animals, less than 1-year of age, generated a lower antibody response to rabies vaccination than adults. Considerably higher failure rates were also observed for different vaccines tested. Regression analysis revealed that two vaccines performed equally well, and significantly better than the others tested. The variation in antibody response relating to length of interval of sampling following vaccination is not unexpected and presumably relates to the response kinetics for primary vaccination.

Methods We obtained data on the number of CS performed in 137 countries, accounting for approximately 95% of global births for that year. Countries with C-section rates below 10% were considered to show underuse, while countries with rates above 15% were considered to show overuse. We estimated the units costs and the quantities of the physical inputs needed in performing CS. Only the marginal costs of the C-section procedure itself were included. Results A total of 54 countries had C-section rates below 10%, whereas 69 showed rates above 15%. 14 countries had rates between 10 and 15%.

Additionally, the test (shell) forming Arcellinida, one of the most species-rich amoebozoan groups, is nested within Tubulinea and suffers from substantial under-sampling of taxa. Here, we increase taxonomic and gene sampling within the Tubulinea, characterizing molecular data for 22 taxa and six genes (SSU rDNA, actin, α- and β-tubulin, elongation factor 2 and the 14-3-3 regulatory protein). We perform concatenated phylogenetic analyses using these genes as well as approximately unbiased tests to assess evolutionary relationships within the Tubulinea.

Arcellinida and Hartmanellidae, the remaining lineages, are not monophyletic in our reconstructions, although statistical testing does not allow rejection of either group.

A widely used inhibitor without reported attenuation of RhoA activity is NSC23766 [(N6-[2-[[4-(diethylamino)-1-methylbutyl]amino]-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl]-2-methyl-4,6-quinolinediamine trihydrochloride]. We found that NSC23766 inhibits the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 mAChR)-induced Rac1 activation in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Surprisingly, NSC27366 concomitantly suppressed the carbachol-induced RhoA activation and a M2 mAChR-induced inotropic response in isolated neonatal rat hearts requiring the activation of Rho-dependent kinases. We therefore aimed to identify the mechanisms by which NSC23766 interferes with the differentially mediated, M2 mAChR-induced responses. Interestingly, NSC23766 caused a rightward shift of the carbachol concentration response curve for the positive inotropic response without modifying carbachol efficacy. To analyze the specificity of NSC23766, we compared the carbachol and the similarly Giβγ-mediated, adenosine-induced activation of Gi protein–regulated potassium channel (GIRK) channels in human atrial myocytes. Application of NSC23766 blocked the carbachol-induced K+ current but had no effect on the adenosine-induced GIRK current. Similarly, an adenosine A1 receptor-induced positive inotropic response in neonatal rat hearts was not attenuated by NSC23766. To investigate its specificity toward the different mAChR types, we studied the carbachol-induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells expressing M1, M2, or M3 mAChRs. NSC23766 caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the carbachol concentration response curves at all mAChRs. Thus, NSC23766 is not only an inhibitor of Rac1 activation, but it is within the same concentration range a competitive antagonist at mAChRs. Molecular docking analysis at M2 and M3 mAChR crystal structures confirmed this interpretation.', 'Magdolna Lévay, K. Krobert, K. Wittig, N. Voigt, M. Bermudez, G. Wolber, D. Dobrev, F. Levy, T.

Carlson warned viewers about the threat posed by the coronavirus from early February, while Hannity originally dismissed the risks associated with the virus before gradually adjusting his position starting late February. We first validate these differences in content with independent coding of show transcripts. In line with the differences in content, we present novel survey evidence that Hannity\'s viewers changed behavior in response to the virus later than other Fox News viewers, while Carlson\'s viewers changed behavior earlier. We then turn to the effects on the pandemic itself, examining health outcomes across counties. First, we document that greater viewership of Hannity relative to Tucker Carlson Tonight is strongly associated with a greater number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the early stages of the pandemic. The relationship is stable across an expansive set of robustness tests. To better identify the effect of differential viewership of the two shows, we employ a novel instrumental variable strategy exploiting variation in when shows are broadcast in relation to local sunset times. These estimates also show that greater exposure to Hannity relative to Tucker Carlson Tonight is associated with a greater number of county-level cases and deaths. Furthermore, the results suggest that in mid-March, after Hannity\'s shift in tone, the diverging trajectories on COVID-19 cases begin to revert. We provide additional evidence consistent with misinformation being an important mechanism driving the effects in the data. While our findings cannot yet speak to long-term effects, they indicate that provision of misinformation in the early stages of a pandemic can have important consequences for how a disease ultimately affects the population.', 'Leonardo Bursztyn, Aakaash Rao, Christopher Roth, David Yanagizawa-Drott');

The conditions may increase depression, and patients may become susceptible to falls, thereby affecting the quality of life of the geriatric population. Investigating the prevalence of persistent tinnitus and chronic/recurrent dizziness in an elderly population and analyzing the association of certain comorbidities with tinnitus and dizziness in southern Taiwan were the main purposes of this study.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis was a cross-sectional study performed in a metropolitan hospital. Hearing tests were conducted in a total of 597 volunteers aged ≥65 years involving 322 (53.9%) men and 275 (46.1%) women recruited in the study. The pure tone average (PTA) and hearing handicap (HH) score were calculated. Patients completed questionnaires regarding the history of hypertension and diabetes and symptoms of tinnitus and dizziness. The association of gender, age, PTA/HH, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) with tinnitus and dizziness were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of persistent tinnitus and chronic/recurrent dizziness was 32.0% and 24.1%, respectively. Tinnitus or dizziness were not associated with age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and MetS but was associated with hearing impairment. Women and those with fasting glucose levels <100 mg/dL were more likely to experience dizziness.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPersistent tinnitus and dizziness were common in an elderly population in southern Taiwan.

Ten PPPD patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled from January to June 2018, and baseline data were collected from all subjects. Videonystagmography (VNG), the vestibular caloric test, the video head impulse test (vHIT) and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) were measured to exclude peripheral vestibular lesions. Functional MRI (fMRI) was conducted in PPPD patients and healthy controls. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity were calculated to explore changes in brain spontaneous functional activity during the resting state. Compared with healthy controls, ALFF and ReHo values in the right precuneus and cuneus were significantly lower in PPPD patients (both P < 0.05). Further seed-based functional connectivity analysis showed decreased functional connectivity between precuneus, cuneus and left precentral gyrus (P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that the spontaneous functional activity of cuneus and precuneus in PPPD patients were altered, potentially leading to abnormal integration of visual and vestibular information. Weakened functional connectivity between the precuneus and the precentral gyrus may be associated with aggravated symptoms during upright posture, active or passive movements.', 'Kangzhi Li, Lihong Si, Bin Cui, Xia Ling, Bo Shen, X.

However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, neuroimaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography have provided pivotal insights into the pathophysiology of PPPD. The aim of this review was to evaluate and summarize the existing data on neuroimaging studies in PPPD. In summary, these studies fairly consistently reported decreased brain structure, function, and connectivity among the areas involved in multisensory vestibular processing and spatial cognition, and increased function and connectivity in the visual processing areas in patients with PPPD. The detected brain changes might reflect maladaptive and compensatory mechanisms including dysfunctional integration of multisensory vestibular information and visual dependence. Notably, various factors including personality traits (i.e., neuroticism), psychiatric comorbidities (i.e., anxiety and depression), and triggering factors (i.e., peripheral vestibular lesions) seem to modulate brain functional activity and connectivity patterns, possibly accounting for some differences across the results. Future studies should carefully control for these confounding effects in order to draw firm conclusions.', 'J. J. Im, Seunghee Na, H. Jeong, Yong-An Chung'),

PPPD constitutes a new definition of chronic functional vestibular disorder which defies the dichotomous conceptualization of organic versus psychogenic [1–5].

As a functional disorder it often arises when structural vestibular deficits produce sustained shifts in balance control triggered by psychological factors and is characterized from the absence of related neurological signs [1, 5].

The study was conducted in male mice. Results We found elevated postpubertal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist–induced hyperlocomotion, age-independent prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits and increased acoustic startle response (ASR). The PPI deficit and increased ASR were resistant to antipsychotic treatment. The PPI deficit was not a consequence of impaired hearing measured by auditory brain stem responses. The Df(h22q11)/+ mice also displayed increased amplitude of loudness-dependent auditory evoked potentials. Prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatal elevations of the dopamine metabolite DOPAC and increased dorsal striatal expression of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 was found.

The clinical presentation of hypoparathyroidism can vary with the serum calcium levels and chronicity of hypocalcemia. Hypoparathyroidism can cause intracranial calcifications but extensive intracranial calcifications are rare. Brain calcinosis syndrome is defined as bilateral calcium accumulation in the brain parenchyma, most often within the basal ganglia. Such intracranial calcifications occur in 0.3-1.5% of patients with hypoparathyroidism, often detected incidentally. The mechanism of intracranial calcification is not completely understood. Its occurrence with hypocalcemia suggests that increased calcium-phosphorus complex formation plays a role. THE CASE A 63-year old female was admitted due to dizziness. She had a fall prior confinement due to loss of consciousness lasting for less than 5 minutes, however, recovered afterwards. No head injury was detected at the referring hospital. She is hypertensive with good BP control on Amlodipine 2.5 mg and Losartan 50 mg taken once daily. She had total thyroidectomy for colloid adenoma 20 years ago, prescribed with Levothyroxine 100 mcg once daily but taken with poor compliance. She had episodes of cold intolerance, hoarseness, and weight gain. On examination, she was conscious and coherent. Blood pressure was 95/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 67 beats per minute. A midline neck scar from previous surgery was visible, no palpable neck mass or lymph nodes. Notable on the neurological examination were positive Rhomberg test and dysmetria evaluated by finger-to-nose test. Chvostek’s and Trosseau’s signs were negative. Motor, sensory and cranial nerve functions were intact. Plain cranial CT scan showed extensive cranial calcifications on both basal ganglia, corona radiata, brainstem and cerebellum. Blood tests revealed low levels of ionized calcium (0.91 mmol/L; N 1.12-1.32 mmol/L)), intact PTH (0.51 pg/ml; N 15-65 pg/ml), and FT4 (5.54 pmol/L; N 12-22 pmol/L). TSH was elevated (32.85 uIU/ml; N 0.27- 4.2 uIU/ml). Calcium with active vitamin D and levothyroxine were given. Physical rehabilitation initiated. Patient was eventually discharged improved, with decreased dizziness. CONCLUSION Basal ganglia calcifications present with diverse manifestations and include seizures, mental deterioration and disorders of the cerebellar or extrapyramidal function. Treatment usually involves calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Marked clinical improvement usually results from treatment of hypoparathyroidism. Measurement and monitoring of serum calcium, phosphorus and intact PTH is warranted. REFERENCE: Ramen C. Basak. A Case Report of Basal Ganglia Calcification - A Rare Finding of Hypoparathyroidism.

Turkiyya Hasan left the Swedish Salaam Mission with scratches on her legs and a suitcase of evidence of missionary misdeeds. Her story hit a nerve among Egyptians, and news of the beating quickly spread through the country. Suspicion of missionary schools, hospitals, and homes increased, and a vehement anti-missionary movement swept the country. That missionaries had won few converts was immaterial to Egyptian observers: stories such as Turkiyya\'s showed that the threat to Muslims and Islam was real. This is a great story of unintended consequences: Christian missionaries came to Egypt to convert and provide social services for children. Their actions ultimately inspired the development of the Muslim Brotherhood and similar Islamist groups. In The Orphan Scandal, Beth Baron provides a new lens through which to view the rise of Islamic groups in Egypt. This fresh perspective offers a starting point to uncover hidden links between Islamic activists and a broad cadre of Protestant evangelicals. Exploring the historical aims of the Christian missions and the early efforts of the Muslim Brotherhood, Baron shows how the Muslim Brotherhood and like-minded Islamist associations developed alongside and in reaction to the influx of missionaries. Patterning their organization and social welfare projects on the early success of the Christian missions, the Brotherhood launched their own efforts to save children and provide for the orphaned, abandoned, and poor. In battling for Egypt\'s children, Islamic activists created a network of social welfare institutions and a template for social action across the country—the effects of which, we now know, would only gain power and influence across the country in the decades to come.

But in the current global context, it is made ever more urgent and necessary. Faced with all these new phenomena that permeate the contemporary world and the Church, renewed enthusiasm and enthusiasm is needed to respond to the urgency and the need for a new evangelization. This inner impulse can only be the result of a rich and singular personal spirituality, without which the evangelizer runs the risk of quickly becoming exhausted or discouraged: Missionary activity requires a specific spirituality which concerns in particular those whom God has called missionaries (RMis 87). This specific spirituality is nourished by the meditation of Christ the Savior - the Word of God. Through this meditation, the new evangelizers experience being healed by God through Jesus Christ. The encounter with the living God is an entirely original, transformative experience that puts everything in its place and completely upsets reality. This results in the ardor of evangelization that is constantly renewed. All evangelization requires from those who announce, a testimony of life that attests to the truth and the reality of the Gospel. To give one\'s testimony on mission is to give an account of what we have lived, seen and heard, and meditation is a good way to carry out this reality. Evangelization has a mystical origin; it is a gift that comes from the cross of Christ the Savior. That is why Christian meditation rooted in the tradition of the Church - especially in the Gospel - is a means for the new evangelization.', 'Piotr Piasecki'),

The article investigates the initial period of the foundation of the Lay Order of Saint Basil the Great, which was covered in the pages of the periodical Misionar in 1897-1898.\n\nThe Lay Order of Saint Basil the Great, the earliest name of which is the Brotherhood of Law of Saint Basil the Great, was founded at the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church in the time of the Dobromil\'s reform of the Basilian Order in 1897 by the hegumen of the monastery of Saint Onuphrius in Lviv, father Andrey Sheptytsky, the Order of Saint Basil the Great, the future metropolitan. In the pages of the periodical Misionar, which was also founded by the hegumen and father Andrey Sheptytsky, the Order of Saint Basil the Great, in May in the year of 1897, within June 1897 - December 1898 the materials were published relating to the earliest period of the foundation of the Lay Order of Saint Basil the Great. This is the period when the father A. Sheptytsky, the Order of Saint Basil the Great, fulfilled the duties of the hegumen of Lviv Monastery until August 26, 1898 and later was appointed as a Professor of moral and dogmatic theology at Krystynopol. The first editor of the periodical was the father Platonid Filias, the Order of Saint Basil the Great. By the time the father A. Sheptytsky, the Order of Saint Basil the Great, became the Stanislavsky bishop (1899), he was also the responsible editor of the periodical Misionar.\n\nThe hegumen and father Andrey Sheptytsky, the Order of Saint Basil the Great, having founded Misionar and having founded the centres of the Brotherhood of Law, used the periodical to popularize the Brotherhood of Law and its development, thus encouraging readers to the perfect Christian life in the world in the community of Brotherhood in order to do good deeds for the benefit of all “Russ community” by joint efforts.\n\nThe periodical provided information about the formation of centres of the Brotherhood of Law in localities, where the Basilian missions took place. The articles were printed that contributed to the formation of new centres and spiritual formation of community members. In particular, under the heading “The Life of the Saints”, the Basilian fathers, telling about the life of Saint Dalmat, his son Favstva and Saint Isaac, encouraged readers of Misionar to imitate the life of these Saints, the monastic life in the world and the formation of monasteries in villages, like the monastery of St. Isaac. They advised how this could be done. In the heading of the periodical “Misionarski Visti” [Missionary News], it was reported in which localities the centres of the Brotherhood of Law were founded. From May till December 1898, the story “The Christian community” was printed in 12 issues of the periodical that described the life of the law and the Christian life in general. These articles contributed to the spiritual formation of the members of the founded Brotherhood of Law and all readers of the periodical as well as the introduction of the “Rules of St. Father N. Vasyl V. for Mirsky people”, which were concluded by the hegumen and father Andrey Sheptytsky, the Order of Saint Basil the Great for the Brotherhood. Thus, favourable conditions were created for the foundation and development of the Lay Order of Saint Basil the Great, and the periodical Misionar played a special role in this. We can assert that the periodical Misionar occupies an honourable place in the entire now more than 120-year history of the existence and activities of the Lay Order of Saint Basil the Great in the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church.', 'Mariia Khrystyiana Holomidova'),

The book examines the growth and influence of Christian foreign policy lobbying groups in the United States beginning in the 1970s, assesses the effectiveness of Christian efforts to attain foreign aid for favored regimes, and considers how those same groups promoted the imposition of economic and diplomatic sanctions on those nations that stifled evangelism. The book links the development of evangelical foreign policy lobbying to the overseas missionary agenda. Its case studies—Guatemala, South Africa, and the Soviet Union—reveal the extent of Christian influence on American foreign policy from the late 1970s through the 1990s. Evangelical policy work also reshaped the lives of Christians overseas and contributed to a reorientation of U.S. human rights policy. Efforts to promote global evangelism and support foreign brethren led activists to push Congress to grant aid to favored, yet repressive, regimes in countries such as Guatemala while imposing economic and diplomatic sanctions on nations that persecuted Christians, such as the Soviet Union.

I pay attention to the active participation in these newspapers by their readers, namely, examining their readership\'s contributions to the papers.

The early Korean Protestant Christians envisioned their own religious community and way of life through the mediated publicness provided by newspapers.

It is more accurate however, to refer to both continuity and discontinuity when one surveys later evangelical narratives of mission service in the attempt to locate them in succession to the mission of Carey. The continuities and discontinuities come into especially sharp relief when one makes this comparison with the theme of ‘sacrifice’ in mind. Understanding the emergence of the discourse of ‘missionary sacrifice’ within later missionary narratives, from the mid-1850s onwards, is key to a more critically nuanced reading of the letters and reports from Carey in his context. Understanding some of the reasons for this development of ‘missionary sacrifice’ discourse involves new line of research within the history of mission and will continue to be relevant to the contemporary practice of discerning and mobilising for the missionary vocation. 1. AN EMERGING EVANGELICAL DISCOURSE OF SACRIFICE a. A mother’s advice to Edith In an article written for the 1848 edition of the ‘The Juvenile Missionary Herald’, we are introduced to Edith. Edith is the young daughter of a British Baptist minister and she has begun entertaining notions of missionary service. Her mother feels compelled to offer parlour-room advice to her young charge, essentially a contemporary exposition of Luke 14:25-33, ‘Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost...?’1 The article, titled ‘The Missionary’s Sacrifice’, is an imaginary conversation between mother and daughter. My much less prosaic version is a bullet-point list of several factors that were understood in the mid nineteenth century as ‘missionary sacrifice’. These included:  Leaving one’s country of birth  A diminished prospect of marriage  The likelihood that marriage would be short or distant  The hazards of nineteenth century travel  The challenge of language-learning and the frustrations of inadequate communication of the gospel  Living in an environment of idolatry or heresy  Isolation from Christian support  Persecution, opposition, or death  The loss of a child or separation from children for many years. The impact on young Edith is immediate, ‘Edith’s tears flowed as she exclaimed, “O mamma, such trials are enough to make people regret becoming missionaries!”’ Unperturbed by what she obviously 1 Concluding the quotation at ‘cost’ serves the purpose of the imagined conversation. The cost of missionary service are the potential sacrifices it will entail. This exposition heightens the cost of missionary service, extended to the possibility of giving one’s life. considers mere inconveniences, Edith’s mamma returns to Luke 14 and encourages her daughter with the claim that she knows of no missionary who has ever ‘repented of the steps he had taken’.2 Such stoicism might be a gospel virtue but it’s hard not to also see it as a reflection of confidence in an age when Victoria ruled a kingdom as well as a rapidly expanding Empire. Imperial expansion extracted its own particular cost and this tended to breed a stoical, even heroic, attitude to hardship and misery, common to missionary and non-missionary alike. Indeed, these were common currency for any European in foreign service during the mid to late nineteenth century. The deprivations associated with missionary service continue to have resonance for the contemporary, evangelical cross-cultural Christian worker. Ed Gross, in the Evangelical Dictionary of World Mission describes missionary sacrifice as an abandonment of self, a giving up of life and possessions, accceptance of suffering, handing over of self-mastery, acknowledgement of divine ownership, and joyous service, in obedience to Christ. He writes, ‘Sacrifice... should be a hallmark of Christian missionaries. On behalf of the gospel, they are often called to forsake many things that are otherwise biblically allowable: cherished relationships, life-long dreams, comfortable living conditions, personal goals and plans, homeland cultures and models of ministry, relative anonymity, financial security, and many personal possessions. They do this willingly while understanding that such sacrifice may not be appreciated even by those whom the Lord has called them to serve. Why endure such things? The worth of souls, the sanctification of sinners, and the example and glory of Christ are the reasons...’3 Of course, it must be reiterated, that hardship and misery were a part of the missionary experience of the early and mid-nineteenth century. The Juvenile Missionary Herald article refers to the deaths of LMS missionaries in the South Pacific. Following Edith’s story is a short report of missionary news that makes reference to the loss at sea of a missionary couple, the murder of two missionaries in Borneo, and disturbances in Haiti. It might not be surprising that a feature of this period, obvious in this 1848 article, was the use of the discourse of ‘sacrifice’ to characterise the experience of Christian missionaries in the mid-nineteenth century. When one considers the disasters, calamities, and hindrances with which young Edith is confronted, one has to ask whether the attempt was intended to extinguish her passion. Of course, the drama of the story is intended to precisely ignite the passions. This point is precisely the issue at stake for the many evangelical publishers of the mid-nineteenth century who made it their personal mission to stimulate evangelical prayer and financial support through their re-telling of stories in which missionary sacrifice was frequently central. Francis Cox writes, in 1844, ‘Surely the missionary press might be made a kind of beating heart, throwing out the life-blood, with a strong and constant stroke, through every arterial channel, to the farthest extremities of the church?’4', 'D.

Hardcastle was a director of the London Missionary Society, and for a missionary of the American Board exiled from India in the midst of the War of 1812, he was the only hope of getting news back to the United States. This article examines the beginnings of American foreign missionary work during the early republic, focusing on the relationship between American and British evangelicals. When British missionaries first began working in India in the 1790s, American evangelicals watched their progress eagerly. Americans interested in missions soon came to argue that they, too, had a duty to evangelize the whole world. With the formation of the ABCFM in 1810, Americans sponsored their own missionaries to the region only to find that working within the British Empire presented new and unexpected challenges. When the first missionaries left American shores for South Asia, the War of 1812 began before they reached their destination and the politics of empire affected the mission and its supporters. By examining the ways that missionaries and their supporters negotiated the tensions between their national identity as Americans and their religious identity as evangelical Christians, this article argues that for these Americans, national identity was created in a global context.', 'Emily Conroy-Krutz'),

For me as a Pentecostal theologian, 2 daughter of Swedish Pentecostal missionaries, raised in Rwanda, and deeply affected by the horrors of ethnic cleansing that occurred in the country, the question of salvation and its relation to good and evil, society and justice has become central to my theological thinking. In this chapter, I will propose a holistic model for understanding salvation as “abundant life” (John 10:10) and suggest that such a model would promote our involvement—as Christians and Pentecostals—in societal reform. To reach that conclusion, I will present insights and examples from the Swedish Pentecostal movement, African Pentecostal theology, and Latin American liberation theology from the 1960s.

In their statement, Kenosha Police said officials responded to “reports of shots being fired and multiple gunshot victims” in the city at about 23:45 on Tuesday (04:45 Wednesday GMT). “The shooting resulted in two fatalities and a third gunshot victim was transported to a hospital with serious, but non-life threatening injuries,” the statement said. It added that the identities of the victims were still being determined and that no further details would be given at this time. An investigation has been opened. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth earlier told the New York Times that an investigation into the shootings would be focused on a group of men armed with guns outside a petrol station. According to BBC, footage shared online showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire multiple rounds at them. Other video shows armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, congregating outside businesses they said they were protecting. TEHRAN – The number of foreign travelers to Iran has drastically plunged due to the global coronavirus pandemic as the Islamic Republic registered only 74 visits during the spring season. “Iran’s [inbound] tourism came to almost zero and the country had 74 foreign tourists in the first three months of this [Iranian calendar] year (started on March 20), due to corona outbreak,” Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Minister Ali-Asghar Mounesan in a televised interview late on Tuesday. Tourism [industry of Iran] was growing before corona [outbreak], its revenues reached $11.7 billion in 2019, which accounted for 2.8% of GDP, nearing the average share of tourism in the world GDP, which was 3.2 percent, the minister explained. He said 8.7 million foreign nationals visited Iran during the past [Iranian] year (1398), adding that Iran was ranked as the second fastest-growing country in tourism based on data compiled by the World Tourism Organization. “On the onset of coronavirus, tourism faced a sharp decline in the world including our country. So that in the first three months of the current [Iranian] year the number of foreign tourists dropped to 74 --it was reached almost zero!.” The minister reminded that some 2.3 million foreign nationals visited the Islamic Republic during spring last year that showed a 40.66 percent increase year on year. The country hosted 1,443,551 million travelers during the same period a year earlier. Talking about losses to the travel and hospitality industry of the country, the minister said that the virus decease has caused damage to many countries around the world, and our country’s travel sector has so far suffered a loss of 12 trillion rials (some $2.85 billion at the official rate of 42,000 rials). 1 0 U.S. isolated more; Trump and Pompeo humiliated', 'M.

A new theory explains this price disparity by uncertain sellers’ and buyers’ strategic reliance on opposite borders of a spectrum of possible utilities of a good. Through a review of concurrent theories, this paper highlights the superiority of the new uncertain utilities theory compared to the loss aversion, bad deal aversion, psychological ownership, and attribution sampling bias explanations of the endowment effect. Despite this, five pilot studies testing the uncertain utilities theory employing the increasing information paradigm fail not only at supporting the theory’s hypotheses but also at finding proper endowment effects altogether. Two successful replications of earlier endowment effect studies using the valuation and exchange paradigms hint to the final theory of the endowment effect: experimental artefacts. The seven studies include nine different goods (mugs, t-shirts, falafel wraps, art prints, chocolate bars, diseases/cures, movie tickets, bananas, and apples) and 422 unique participants. The results suggests that the endowment effect may to some extent be an experimental artefact.

Postbiotics, used as dietary additives for livestock, could be potential alternatives to antibiotics. Postbiotics produced from the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum have been the subject of several recent kinds of research. However, the researchers have very rarely considered the effect of postbiotics on the broilers under heat stress. Abstract The purpose of this work was to evaluate the impacts of feeding different postbiotics on oxidative stress markers, physiological stress indicators, lipid profile and meat quality in heat-stressed broilers. A total of 252 male Cobb 500 (22-day-old) were fed with 1 of 6 diets: A basal diet without any supplementation as negative control (NC); basal diet + 0.02% oxytetracycline served as positive control (PC); basal diet + 0.02% ascorbic acid (AA); or the basal diet diet + 0.3% of RI11, RS5 or UL4 postbiotics. Postbiotics supplementation, especially RI11 increased plasma activity of total-antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH), and decreased alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein (α1-AGP) and ceruloplasmin (CPN) compared to NC and PC groups. Meat malondialdehyde (MDA) was lower in the postbiotic groups than the NC, PC and AA groups. Plasma corticosterone, heat shock protein70 (HSP70) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were not affected by dietary treatments. Postbiotics decreased plasma cholesterol concentration compared to other groups, and plasma triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) compared to the NC group.

These adverse experiences can include abuse, neglect, and witnessing crime, parental conflict, mental illness, and substance abuse. Adverse childhood experiences have been linked to risky behaviors, chronic health conditions, and early death, resulting in stress that can derail healthy brain development. Adverse experiences also increase risks for dozens of illnesses and unhealthy behaviors, including smoking, alcoholism, depression, heart disease, suicide, unintended pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus/sexually transmitted diseases, and cancer. The risk for these poor outcomes increases with each adverse experience. In this month’s issue of Pediatric Research, Gardner et al. describe how adverse childhood experiences before age 9 years increases the odds of obesity in adolescence. Of note, the authors considered the effects of many adverse childhood experiences beyond those included in an earlier study known as the “ACEs study”; for simplicity, we refer here to all such adverse childhood experiences as ACEs. Among these additional, stress-inducing experiences were death of a parent, close family member or a close friend; relocation; need for a foster home; serious illness of the child or a family member; and parental conflict. These results contribute substantially to the collective evidence that ACEs adversely impact the subsequent health of children, an effect compounded by poverty. Collectively, these findings support the need to consider social determinants when developing behavioral strategies for promoting healthy development, including weight status, particularly in early adolescence. The presence of ACEs does NOT condemn a child to poor adultonset outcomes. Protective factors prevent children from experiencing adversity and can defend against many associated, negative health outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended five activities to prevent the impact of ACEs: strengthen economic supports to families, change social norms to support parents and positive parenting, provide quality early-life child care and education, enhance parenting skills, and intervene to mitigate harm and prevent future risk (i.e., enhanced primary care, parenting programs, treatment to lessen harms of abuse and neglect). For instance, Brotman et al. demonstrated that supporting parents by offering evidence-based parenting interventions during preschool can promote healthy child development and prevent obesity during adolescence. The weight of this evidence has already motivated changes in clinical practice, school policies, and legislation at state and local levels, all aiming to mitigate the long-term effects of ACEs. For example, the California legislature passed ACR 155, encouraging policies to reduce ACEs, in 2014; and in 2017, Vermont passed bill No. 43, H. 508, aiming to screen for and address ACEs in schools and health-care clinics. In response to the growing evidence for lasting and progressive adverse effects of ACEs on diverse health outcomes and recognizing the complexity, scale, and difficulty involved in addressing this issue, the CDC now provides extensive educational resources and prevention strategies, including information to foster safe and nurturing environments and relationships for children, and technical packages to prevent childhood abuse and neglect. Efforts such as these demonstrate the growing recognition that the health-care industry plays a critical role in screening our pediatric patients for ACEs and intervening appropriately. Increased attention to early childhood adversity may achieve multiple public health benefits. However, modern pediatric practices face daunting hurdles in operationalizing recommendations to screen for ACEs. Despite the evidence for benefit, thirdparty payors are not widely incentivizing screening with additional reimbursement. Screening for ACEs necessitates access to referral sources, which are often lacking. Obtaining mental health services, for example, is becoming increasingly difficult as psychiatric providers participate in fewer insurance plans. For instance, <50% of psychiatrists nationwide currently accept Medicaid, the primary insurer (with the Children’s Health Insurance Plan [CHIP]) for 45 million (48%) US children. Unfortunately, Medicaid enrollment is itself a risk factor for ACEs. For other referrals indicated by ACEs screening, pediatric insurance networks limit access to subspecialists, further impeding access to care. In the face of these challenges, it is unsurprising that only ~4% of pediatricians reportedly screen for all major ACEs known to be associated with long-term sequelae. As payors migrate toward value-based payment strategies, however, opportunities exist to incentivize widespread screening for ACEs. Payment reform advocates maintain that the primary value of pediatric care is prevention of adult-onset disease. Following this logic, small, highly vulnerable pediatric populations should warrant increased, earlier attention and increased health-care resources. States are actively adopting screenings for parental health issues, such as post-partum depression and smoking, as part of both pediatric and maternal value-based care. Reporting these metrics and achieving performance targets would merit increased', 'Joyce R Javier, L. Hoffman, Shetal I Shah'),

The author argues that Locke had lost fate in the peaceful co-existence of men in the state of nature in which Lock claimed many things are wanting. The society is said to be more peaceful when there are means to maintain freedom, peace and security. To achieve this end, society of men must come into agreement with each other in order to ascribe roles and responsibilities to people in manning the affairs of the state. The work contends that the political thoughts provided by Lock served as a revolutionary tool for radical political thinkers in history and modern times. It set the platform for the causes of most civil disobediences and political revolutions especially, when men of the legislative order failed to deliver the good for which they were elected. Reviews of equally similar scholarly writings suggest that these revolutionary trends continue to have serious grip on the role of the state in recent times. The paper investigates the areas where states have gone wrong in living up to their tasks and concludes that states that have bridged the social contract have been plunged into conflict leading to the complete dissolution of the autocratic order as in the case of the Sierra Leone’s civil war, 1991 – 2002.', 'Alhaji Mustapha Javombo');

This marks the fi rst time emerald ash borer has been found in the state. North Carolina is the 20th state in the country to confi rm the presence of the destructive pest, following the discovery of an adult beetle and other signs of borer activity in trees in Granville County by staff with the N.C. Forest Service. Additional surveying found signs of emerald ash borer activity in the bordering counties of Person and Vance. “The detection of this pest is not unexpected, especially given the presence of the beetle in Virginia and Tennessee,” said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler. “We have been surveying and trapping sites along the state borders for several years for any signs of the movement of this pest. A federal quarantine will be coming shortly, but I am invoking this emergency quarantine to take every step possible to restrict the movement of emerald ash borer any further.” The beetle was fi rst detected in the U.S. in Michigan in 2002. It is responsible for the death or decline of tens of millions of ash trees across the country. Under the state quarantine, all hardwood fi rewood and plants and plant parts of the ash tree -including living, dead, cut or fallen, green lumber, stumps, roots, branches and composted and uncomposted chips -cannot be moved outside the three counties. The N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’ Plant Industry Division and N.C. Forest Service are working in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. “Detecting and preventing the human spread of the emerald ash borer is a huge undertaking,” said Deborah Stewart, USDA state plant health director for North Carolina. “We need everyone’s cooperation to minimize the impacts of this pest.” Symptoms of emerald ash borer in ash trees include a general decline in the appearance of the tree, such as thinning from the top down and loss of leaves. Clumps of shoots, also known as epicormic sprouts, emerging from the trunk of the tree and increased woodpecker activity are others. The emerald ash borer is not the only pest that can cause these. Emerald ash borers overwinter as larvae. Adult beetles begin to emerge from May to June and can be found in the summer months. The adult beetle is one-fourth to a half-inch long and is slender and metallic green. When the adults emerge from a tree, they leave behind a D-shaped exit hole. The larvae can also create serpentine tunneling marks, known as feeding galleries, which are found under the bark of the infested trees. Home and landowners are encouraged to report any symptomatic activity in ash trees to the NCDA&CS Plant Industry Division hotline at 1-800-2069333 or by email at newpest@ ncagr.gov. The pest can affect any of the four types of ash trees grown in the state.', 'Commissioner, Steve, Troxler'),

At the same time, authorities have decided to completely lockdown 75 districts except essential services where coronavirus cases were reported as several States announced extraordinary measures to check the spread of the disease which has left 396 infected and seven dead. The three casualties reported on Sunday were from Bihar, Gujarat and Maharasthtra. A 38-year-old man with a kidney ailment and recent travel history to Qatar died at AIIMSPatna and a 67-year-old man died at a hospital in Surat in Gujarat, state officials said. The Union Health Ministry was yet to confirm the deaths were caused by coronavirus. Another death was reported from Mumbai of a 63-year-old man. Even before the Government order, several States like Punjab, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra went for complete lockdown with an aim to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission. The Union Health Ministry has asked the States to earmark a certain number of hospitals to exclusively treat COVID-19 patients. The Railway Ministry has urged the people to “postpone all journeys”, a day after three incidents involving 12 people were reported as they were found to be travelling on trains despite being instructed to go for quarantine. All of them tested positive. Soon after the Centre and State Governments following a meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to completely lock down 75 districts across the country where coronavirus cases have been reported, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director Balram Bhargava told reporters here that a lockdown was the most essential aspect to the break the chain of transmission as of now. “Each State has pledged that they will earmark hospitals exclusively to treat COVID-19 patients,” Bhargava said. “For example, in Delhi, AIIMS’ division of National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Jhajjar (Haryana) — which has around 800 beds — would be used only to treat COVID-19 patients,” he said. Bhargava stated that 60 private labs had registered so far to conduct coronavirus tests. He said India is capable of conducting 10,000 coronavirus tests a day and conducted 5,000 tests last week. Speaking to the media, Bhargava said the testing capacity could be increased above 10,000, if needed. “It’s important that indiscriminate testing is not done. Those returning from abroad should go for isolation,” he said. In view of no let up in the Covid-19 cases, the Government gave an order to procure 1,200 new ventilators, said Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal. He talked about the steps taken to contain the virus that has claimed over 13,000 lives worldwide. The decisions were taken at a high-level meeting of chief secretaries of all States and the Cabinet Secretary and the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, officials said on Sunday. In the meeting, it was decided to suspend all train services till March 31, including suburban rail services. However, goods trains are exempted. All metro rail services were also suspended till March 31, the officials said. Subsequently, the railways announced suspension of all its 13,523 passenger trains from March 22 midnight to March 31 midnight and said only goods trains will run during the said period. The suspensions also include all suburban train services. The railways had already trimmed down its services on Friday by cancelling a majority of trains. However, it had allowed all trains that had already started the journey to continue. “No train except goods trains will run till 2400 hrs of March 31. However, a bare minimum of suburban services and the Kolkata Metro Rail service will continue to run till 2400 hours of March 22. Thereafter, these services will also be stopped till 2400 hours of March 31,” a spokesperson of the Indian Railways said. The trains that had already commenced their journey prior to 4 am on March 22 will run up to their respective destinations, the railways said, adding that adequate arrangements would be made for the passengers during the travel and at their destinations. “To ensure the essential supplies in various parts of the country, movement of goods trains will continue,” the Railway Ministry said in a statement.

With businesses closed, supply chains disrupted, timelines extended and contracts terminated, this exercise has caused the organized sector unprecedented economic losses. In the unorganized sector, there has been a complete breakdown with little or no legal recourse for those who are affected. While the lockdown has helped contain community spread of the disease, a legal and legislative audit of this exercise has evaded scrutiny so far. As we are now in the seventh week of the lockdown, it is imperative and timely that we assess its underlying legislative soundness. Introduction:Laws governing lockdown The lockdown has been carried out by State governments and district authorities on the directions of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs under the Disaster Management Act of 2005, which was intended “to provide for the effective management of disasters and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto”. Under the Act, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was set up under the leadership of the Prime Minister, and the National Executive Committee (NEA) was chaired by the Home Secretary. On March 24, 2020, the NDMA and NEA issued orders directing the Union Ministries, State governments and authorities to take effective measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and laid out guidelines illustrating which establishments would be closed and which services suspended during the lockdown period. Taking a cue from the guidelines, the State governments and authorities exercised powers under the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 to issue further directions. For instance, the Health and Family Welfare Department of Tamil Nadu issued a government order on March 23, 2020, to impose social distancing and isolation measures which directed “suspected cases and foreign returnees” to remain “under strict home quarantine” and people “to stay at home and come out only for accessing basic and essential services and strictly follow social distancing norms”. Subsequently, on March 25, the earlier order was extended for a period of 21 days, in accordance with the directions of the NEA. District authorities such as the Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai, have consequently issued orders to impose Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in public places. Union-State co-ordination In India, both Houses of Parliament functioned till March 23, 2020, when they were adjourned sine die. There were a number of interventions regarding COVID-19 by Opposition members through the session. However, the Union government showed no inclination towards drafting or enacting a COVID-19-specific legislation that could address all the issues pre-emptively. In fact, there has been little clarity on a road map to economic recovery after the announcement by the Union Finance Minister last month. © 2020 JETIR June 2020, Volume 7, Issue 6 www.jetir.org (ISSN-2349-5162) JETIR2006126 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org 909 The Law and Limits of Quarantine:As Covid-19 spreads around the globe, governments have imposed quarantines and travel bans on an unprecedented scale. China locked down whole cities, and Italy has imposed draconian restrictions throughout the country. In the United States, thousands of people have been subjected to legally enforceable quarantines or are in “self-quarantine.” The federal government has also banned entry by non–U.S. nationals traveling from China, Iran, and most of Europe and is screening passengers returning from heavily affected countries. Still, the numbers of cases and deaths continue to rise. Quarantines and travel bans are often the first response against new infectious diseases. However, these old tools are usually of limited utility for highly transmissible diseases, and if imposed with too heavy a hand, or in too haphazard a manner, they can be counterproductive.1 with a virus such as SARS-CoV-2, they cannot provide a sufficient response. Inside the country, isolation and quarantine orders have traditionally come from the states. Courts have typically upheld these orders in deference to the states’ broad powers to protect public health. Nevertheless, courts have occasionally intervened when a quarantine was unreasonable or when officials failed to follow necessary procedures. For example, in Jew Ho v. Williamson (1900), a federal court struck down a quarantine imposed by San Francisco in response to an outbreak of bubonic plague because it was racially motivated and ill-suited to stop the outbreak. The federal quarantine power is limited to preventing the spread of communicable diseases into the country or across state lines. Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act grants the Surgeon General the power (since delegated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) to apprehend, detain, or issue a conditional release for the purpose of preventing the introduction into the country, or the spread across state lines, of a quarantinable disease, as designated by executive order (see box). The current list includes “severe acute respiratory syndromes,” which encompasses Covid-19.We must also reduce hurdles to testing and care. The House bill would provide free testing, but more needs to be done to ensure that testing kits are available. Furthermore, noncitizens must be protected from adverse immigration consequences for seeking testing or care or for complying with contact tracing. Finally, emergency guidance or regulations can be issued to limit the financial impact of high-deductible health plans and “surprise bills” from out-of-network providers for Covid-19 diagnosis or treatment. Future Directions:Looking into the near future, containing the COVID-19 epidemic is likely to take several months; public health interventions will be directed towards social distancing and improving hygienic practices. These interventions will be effective in delaying the onset of wide community transmission, reducing peak incidence and its impact on public services. Testing, contact tracing, isolation of infected, and precautionary self-isolation of contacts is critical in reducing the number of new cases. An exceptionally high degree of understanding in the population and acceptance of these measures is also critical. These interventions have to be balanced with getting back to normal life and everyday activities to the best extent possible until a reversing the trajectory of the pandemic is traced. A little knowledge is available so far on alternate routes of transmission, namely via sewage, contaminated water, or air conditioning systems. It is also poorly known if those who have © 2020 JETIR June 2020, Volume 7, Issue 6 www.jetir.org (ISSN-2349-5162) JETIR2006126 Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research (JETIR) www.jetir.org 910 recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection would be protected from reinfection, but evidence to confirm this is yet to be generated. Antibody testing has to be implemented on a large scale to identify who is already immune to the virus. The effect of temperature, season, and humidity on COVID-19 also has an impact on the COVID-19 outbreak, however, results from other parts of the world are awaited. One of the last concerns regards the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak. Asian countries and cities that seemed to have brought the coronavirus epidemic under control are suddenly tightening their borders and imposing stricter containment measures, fearful about new imported infections. Hong Kong suddenly saw new cases spike as high as 65 in one day and ordered a new closure of non-essential activities. In Japan, where infections have remained relatively controlled, cases started to rise in March as travelers returned in the home country. New cases of local transmission have also been detected. Similarly, Singapore again announced one-month lockdown in view of increased local transmission. This portends a worrisome sign for the United States, Europe, India and the rest of the world regarding the second wave of the virus spreading once the restrictive measures are relieved. Conclusion:Over the past two months, COVID-19 has emerged as a public health threat around the world. It adds to the list of previous epidemic infectious disease outbreaks, including Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis in 1986, the Avian flu in 1997, the SARS in 2002, the Swine Flu in 2009, and the Ebola in 2014. All these outbreaks remind us that we live in a habitat where it is necessary to respect the relationship between animal, social life, and the environment to survive and thrive. Rapid urbanization and our incursion into forest lands, has created a new interface between humans and wildlife; and exposed humans to unfamiliar organisms often involving the consumption of exotic wildlife. As stated by the UN Environment Chief, Inger Anderson Our continued erosion of wild space has brought us uncomfortably close to animal and plants that harbor diseases that can jump to humans. She said, If we don\'t take care of nature, we can\'t take care of ourselves. With COVID-19, nature is sending us a message that we need to recognize the interrelationship between animals, including pets, livestock and wildlife. The transdisciplinary One Health approach involving professionals from many disciplines such as medicine, veterinary, environmental health, and social sciences has been advocated to limit new infectious outbreaks. The global experience is teaching that containment measures and aggressive contract tracing are mandatory to keep the infection under control until an approved treatment or a vaccine is available to the global community. They should also minimize the economic burden of disease, and improve understanding of disease mechanisms, health problems, disease emergence, and reemergence to respond in a proportionate and timely manner. This will help in detecting, prevent', 'Gaargi Tomar, D. K. Jha, Bharti Nair'),

Amid Coronavirus which had initially started off as an epidemic and was finally declared pandemic has forced nations across the world to come up with new policies to protect their citizens from this virus. China, Italy and India have been taken as a case study for the present research as the researchers believe these are the countries which have been the most affected at different stages of COVID 19 and have followed a narrative approach using secondary data that has been gathered from various news articles. The researchers have identified the policies used by each country separately and then conducted a comparative study on the policies of these three countries. The aim of the research paper is to understand the policies taken up by the countries to fight the pandemic COVID 19 and understand which was the best policy among these three countries policies and finally highlight policy recommendations which other nations have inculcated\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n To identify the successful policies used by China,Italy and India in containing COVID 19\n \n \n METHODS\n For the current study the researchers have decided to use narrative research for the qualitative study in question. The researchers will conduct a comparative analysis between the three countries policies to identify their similarities and differences\n \n \n RESULTS\n As India is a democratic country and is home to a diverse set of people, India cannot implement policies without the support of its people. There has been some insight on the community reaction to policies imposed by governments. Italian’s as a community are considered to be a’ happy go lucky’ bunch. Hence when coronavirus sprung up in Italy, it was not taken seriously. Bars, shopping malls and pubs remained open. This is one of the reasons why Italy is said to have been the most impacted by this pandemic. \nChina has been known to follow a very stringent political system. The general public have no other option but to follow rules and regulations without questioning them. Hence, policies imposed by the centre were followed and the pandemic could be contained faster than it was in Italy.\nIndia as a nation houses a plethora of people from different cultural and economic backgrounds. On one hand there are states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Goa which are compared to economies of the developed world while on the other hand, there exist states like Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand which lay on the lower rung on the economic development ladder. An individual\'s adherence to government policies is highly dependent on their level of education. While a part of the public strictly followed the statutes proclaimed by their state governments, the other half chose to believe in baseless WhatsApp forwards and other misinformation and hoaxes about the coronavirus.\n To monitor the reaction of the citizens and to give them enough time to prepare for the temporary lockdown, the Prime Minister first implored that all the citizens should observe a self-imposed curfew from 7am to 9pm on Sunday, March 22nd 2020. This allowed the prime minister and the government to understand which states will comply with a lockdown and which states need more iteration in terms of stricter rules such as shoot at site and more security to make sure people remain quarantined during a longer lockdown period.\nThe Indian government had decided to move the nation into a lockdown period, where they had come out with a comprehensive list of essential services that will remain open during the nationwide lockdown. This list had been put in place by the Ministry of Home Affairs soon after PM Narendra Modi had called for a 21 day nationwide lock down so that the people do not begin to panic about the availability of the essential commodities and medicines as the various state governments were to work together to ensure this. The offices of the Government of India along with the Offices of the State /Union territory shall remain closed and the only exemptions under these offices are the defence, central armed police forces, treasury, public utilities (including petroleum, CNG, LPG, PNG), disaster management and prisons, power generation and transmission units , post offices ,National Informatics centre, Early Warning Agencies. All hospitals and all related medical establishments including their manufacturing and distribution units are to remain open while the transportation for all medical personnel, nurses, Para medical staff and other hospital support services are to be permitted. All commercial , Industrial and Private establishments are to be closed down unless these shops are dealing with food, groceries, fruits and vegetables, dairy and milk booths, meat and fish, animal fodder or if they are manufacturing units of essential commodities or if there is a continuous process that has received the permission from the state governments. However, district authorities are encouraging and facilitating home delivery to minimize the movement of individuals outside their homes. Transportation services have been suspended unless it is the transportation of essential goods or for Fire, Law and order and emergency services. All educational institutions, places of worship and social, political, sports, entertainment gatherings have been barred and the only form of gathering is that of a funeral and not more than 20 people will be permitted.\nContainment measures have been taken by the country where individuals who have arrived in the nation post 15th February 2020 are to be directed by a health care personnel to remain under strict home/ institutional quarantine for a period as decided by the local health authorities ,failing which they will be liable to legal actions under Sec. 188 of the IPC. If there are exceptions to the containment measures the individuals are required to take the necessary precautions as well as social distancing as advised by the health department from time to time.\nThe government has taken the initiative to distribute five kgs of wheat or rice and one kg of preferred pulse free of cost for the next 3 months to the 80 crore poor people across the country so that they can deal with the economic impact of the lock down amid coronavirus. This is being distributed in the households under the Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana which is covered by the National Food Security Act. This is permitting the government to provide food grains per person at a subsidised rate. The beneficiaries will get free ration above their monthly quota of 5 kg food grains per month which has now been increased to 7 kilograms a month for the next three months.\nWhile India has taken as much precaution as possible to protect its citizens it has also lent a helping hand to the Chinese when they were in need due to the challenges of the epidemic which caused a shortage in medical supplies. India had taken it upon itself to send a consignment of medical supplies to China keeping all close cooperation that are enjoyed in various areas between the nations.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n The first suggestion is for the formation of a contact tracing team. Anyone who has been tested as positive for the virus is kept in the hospital and away from friends and family. All those who have been in contact with those who tested positive are monitored by a contact tracing team who identify the contacts of the infected person and ring them up to see if they show any symptoms, if they do, they are picked up from their location and tested. However, if they show no symptoms are kept in a strict home quarantine and they get an SMS several times a day and they have to click on the link so that the team can track where one’s phone is, to make sure that one is quarantined. There are harsh penalties if the individuals are found to be cheating the contact tracing team.\nOur next policy recommendation is one that borrows ideologies from behavioural economics. Decision makers can reward those who give out information about those who conceal information from the authorities. This acts as positive reinforcement and aids in finding those and containing the pandemic.\nThere is a dire need for expansion of our telehealth services. Medical infrastructure should be expanded and physicians in specialties other than contagious disease should be brought in. Diagnostic and telehealth services must be easily accessible to the public. Restrictions on state border travel should be lifted to meet demands created in outbreak areas.\n', 'Devika Rose Roy, Rukmani Singaram'),

In this paper, I am including eight plays of Edward Albee – The Zoo Story, The Sand Box, The American Dream, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Tiny Alice, A Delicate Balance, All Over, Listening. Edward Albee does not fit into the watertight compartments of absurd drama as he mingles realism, expressionism, and ‘absurdism’ in his plays. The oscillations between the different dramatic modes in Albee’s plays are traces of the socio-historical-political-cultural module of the then American society wherein Albee grew up and wrote his plays, thus structuring Albee as an ‘absurdist’ playwright and not as an ‘absurd’ playwright. Key wards: Dramatics modes, Absurdism, Realism, Expressionism, Existentialism One of the most fascinating characteristics of modern American drama is the medley of the different dramatic modes in it. The dramatic modes are realism, expressionism, existentialism and absurdity. These modes mingle in the works of the same period and in the works of the major playwrights. A single mode cannot characterise the works of the major playwrights like Eugene O‟Neill, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and Edward Albee. The developments of the dramatic modes is visualized in the realistic plays of Henrik Ibsen, then to the expressionistic plays of August Strindberg, and last but not the least, the absurdist plays of Samuel Beckett. With the changes in the dramatic modes, the changes occurs in the notion of character, which further leads to the changes in dialogues, plot development and dramatic representation as well. Characterisation plays a vital role in the development of modern drama. In Ibsen‟s realistic plays there appears to be a strong relationship between an individual and his social existence. Arthur Miller says “society is inside of man and man is inside society, and you cannot even create a truthfully drawn psychological entity on the stage until you understand his social relations and their power to make him what he is and to prevent him from being what he is not( Martin 139). Again, in Strindberg‟s expressionistic plays, the characters are something much less rational and amalgamated than in the realist tradition, something emotional rather than rational, and something dangerously fragmented and vague. In absurdist plays, the characters are locked-up in alienation and isolation, where there is no outlet except in the existence of real and forceful human needs to interaction, communication and contact. No real communication takes place and the characters live in a void cut off from historical and societal contexts. Thus, there occurs disintegration of dialogues, and even plot of the play. Martin Esslin is quite right when he says that in theatre of the absurd there occurs “the devaluation and disintegration of language” (Esslin 396). In absurd drama, meaningful order is abandoned, but it may be metaphorical as Waiting for Godot is a metaphor for the meaninglessness of life. In Edward Albee, there is the medley of dramatic modes. What makes The Zoo Story (1959) and The Death of Bessie Smith (1960) dense and difficult to define is the style in which it is written. It does not fit into the purely realistic nor the totally absurd genres that were both popular in 1958 when Albee wrote the play. Albee uses the absurd style and combines it with acute realism in his plays in order to comment on American society in the 1950s. The playwright is also drawing from existential philosophy in his plays. „Absurdism‟ as well as expressionism is found in The Sandbox (1960) and Medley of Dramatic Modes in Edward Albee’s Plays Rumi Rani Laskar & Dipendu Das Volume-I, Issue-II September 2014 130 The American Dream (1961)), realism in Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1961)), symbolist expressionism in Tiny Alice (1964), realism again in A Delicate Balance (1966), surrealist expressionism in Box and Quotations from Chairman Mao TseTung (1968), expressionism with some hues of realism in All Over (1970), a realistic framework in Seascape (1975), something between absurd and expressionistic drama in Listening (1976), and „absurdism‟ in Counting the Ways (1977). I would like to pay no heed to the chronology in this paper, but rather would like to amalgamate the plays based on their thematic concerns. In this paper, I am including eight plays of Edward Albee – The Zoo Story, The Sand Box, The American Dream, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Tiny Alice, A Delicate Balance, All Over, Listening. Since Albee started his career as a realist playwright with The Zoo Story, so let me include the realist plays together. Brian Way in Albee and the Absurd: The American Dream and The Zoo Story, argues that The Zoo Story partly belongs in the tradition of the theatre of the absurd because the action and the dialogue are dislocated and arbitrary, and because it uses the technique of pseudo-crisis (in Jerry\'s long story about the dog) (Bigsby 1975: 37-41). Albee‟s first play The Zoo Story effectively gave birth to American absurdist drama. The theme of isolation, alienation, loneliness is representative of the human condition in this play. The characters lack simple social skills and go on alienating themselves from the rest of the world. Pain follows this isolation, thus compelling an individual to embrace death. In this play, the theme of wealth and poverty, and the illusions that are created between the social and economic classes. It is closely related to isolation and separation because Albee establishes the societal pressures of class as the cause of his character‟s (Jerry) sufferings. With The Zoo Story, Albee points to the French playwright Eugene Ionesco‟s idea that human life is both fundamentally absurd and terrifying, therefore, communication through language is equally absurd. The playwright uses various literary devices in his plays – the first device is that of the anti-hero. Along with the anti-hero, he uses satire and black humour also. Albee uses both of these devices in The Zoo Story to comment on the way different social classes choose to view and ignore each other in American society. Specifically, he highlights the way in which members of the upper classes deal with members of the lower ones. This is illustrated with the character of Peter, who Albee uses as an example by having Jerry methodically bring him down to an animalistic level in order to show that he is just like everyone else. The Sand Box as well as The American Dream shows isolation taking place within the social arrangement, the family in the context of the period‟s excessively consumerist society. It also shows individuals isolated from responsibility and reality. As Albee himself said: “...it is an examination of the American scene, an attack on the substitution of artificial for real value in our society... a stand against fiction that everything in this sleeping land of ours is peachy-keen (Amacher 61). These two plays do not use repetition and circularity like that of absurd drama, but have plot development leading to climax at the end of the play. Thus, in and out these two plays cannot be considered as absurdist, whereas they may be termed as expressionistic plays. The destruction of language and break of communication amongst the characters put forward the elements of absurdism in these plays. These features are purely absurd, but they function within a specific social context in the plays, which makes them part of a meaningful rather than a hollow worldview. Throughout The Sand Box and The American Dream, Albee dramatizes the damage of human empathy and accepting it through specific social attitudes that are savage and dehumanizing. In Edward Albee‟s plays there seem to be a deconstruction of human privilege over animals. The plays seem to be a proof of civilization‟s decadence or may be even possessing the breath of apocalypse. In The Zoo Story, The American Dream, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, the primary conflict is observed in the theme of language and communication breakdown and Albee positions his characters into „speciesist‟ discourses against one another for a myriad of purposes, specifically as a way to make sense of their position within a society. The animal, an entity that humans have tried to mitigate as inferior and uncivilized is very much within human beings, within one-self. In the plays of Albee, it seems that the animal has transformed into a philosophical centre of discourse, where the „mark‟ of Derrida can be used. The animal is placed by the human outside the borders of the human through the distinctive and extremist strategies that the binary of Animal/Human has begun to collapse upon itself. In fact, these strategies have become so overtly extreme that the human, in fearing the loss of civilization, has animalized the human and, in this act of animalizing the subject, the hierarchy of human over animal has been overturned. Medley of Dramatic Modes in Edward Albee’s Plays Rumi Rani Laskar & Dipendu Das Volume-I, Issue-II September 2014 131 Bigsby in his essay, “Edward Albee: Journey to Apocalypse”, in Modern American Drama, 19452000 (2000) says, “ Nevertheless, without fail, all of Albee‟s plays bring up the question of the animal in some shape or form, as with the theme of civility in A Delicate Balance, as religious breakdown in Tiny Alice, and most notably in a direct questioning of animal-human discourse in The Zoo Story and Seascape. Even in the 21st century, when the theatre community has come to view Albee as a hoary playwright of the past, his play The Goat: Or Who is Sylvia?, a play centred entirely on an animal and the theme of bestiality... (Bigsby 2000: 150). The animal exists in Albee‟s plays as a theatrical effect, a literary technique to render emphasis to the breakdown of Human and American society altogether. Albee, essentially, hollows out the human subject and leads his characters to a more “primitive” being, ', 'Rumi Rani Laskar'),

Up to the present the total number of cases of cholera of which the authorities at Whitehall have official cognisance as having occurred in England and Wales from August 25th is 24, of which 9 have proved fatal. These have been distributed as follows:-Gravesend, 5 cases, with 3 deaths; Grimsby, 5 cases with no deaths; London, 3 cases, with I death; Falmouth, 3 cases, with no deaths; Liverpool, 4 cases, with 2 deaths; Middlesbrough, 1 case, which proved fatal ; North Shields, 1 case ; Bolton, 1 case, which proved fatal ; Tynemouth, 1 case, which proved fatal. This list does not include the cases reported at Glasgow. and Grangemouth. In addition to these 24 cases, there have been some cases of suspected cholera, that is to say, cases of acute diarrhcea, in which no relation with Hamburg, Havre, or any other infected place could be traced; the number of these may be put down at about 25. The 24 cases of undoubted cholera were all imported from abroad, and in no single instance has the disease spread to any individual in this country. This is certainly an achievement on which the Local Government Board may be heartily congratulated, evideiicing as it does a state of preparedness which is probably unique in the history of epidemics. Our sanitary authorities have never had to meet such an emergency before, as the disease travelled with unprecedented swiftness, and reached our shores almost simultaneously at a number of different ports along the coast from Falmouth to the Tyne. From the first appearance of the cloud no bigger than a man\'s hand in the East, the march of the disease was carefully watched from Whitehall, and as soon as it was seen to be approaching the provinces in Russia within the pale of settlement from which the emigration of Jews is constantly taking place into and across this country, inspectors were sent by the Local Government Board to all the ports on the east coast\' to warn the local authorities of the probable advent of cholera, and to urge them to complete their sanitary defences in time to repel the threatened invasion. Ever since July 25th the inspectors have been steadily at work, and the Local Government Board has reason to be satisfied with the manner in whiqh the local authorities have carried out their sutggestions. The danger was in the present instance greatly aggravated by the character of the people conveying the infection, and, in particular, by their having as a rule no address in this country whereby they could be kept under observation. There is reason to believe that the enemy has been successfully repulsed for the time, but it is important to realise that the danger is not yet over. The seeds of the fell disease have been widely scattered about in Russia and Germany, and also, though to a smaller extent, in France; and it is by no means unlikely that next spring or summer the advent of warm weather may again stir them up to mischievous activity. In such an event the danger would be immensely greater than it is at present, inasmuch as the disease would break out close at hand, or, in other words, would be nearer to us by some months than it was at the beginning of the present epidemic. In such a case we might expect the unwelcome guest to arrive here in June, and, with the whole summer belore it, there would be full time for the disease to develop to the highest pitch of intensity. It is well, therefore, while congratulating ourselves on having probably escaped present peril, that we should not lose sight of the\' possibility that we may even now be on the eve of a general epidemic that \'would devastate the whole of Europe. There is some comfort, however, in the thought that Russia and Germany have probably learnt wisdom by bitter experience, and so may be induced to set their houses in sanitary order before it is too late. In any case. the authorities in this country must not be content with the temporary success they have achieved, but must bear steadfastly in mind that they may have before theua far harder task than they have yet ha to undertake. Si v48 pacem para bellunt is not less true in sanitary than in international policy, and it is to be hoped that the crisis which we are now passing through may lead to a great advance in sanitary administration. We trust the Local Government Board will not relax its present system of inspection, but will make it as. constant and systematic as the inspection of schools. The present system of painstaking inquiry into the causes of outbreaks, excellent as it is, is too much in the nature of the ex post facto vigilance illustrated by the proverb about locking the stable door when the horse has been stolen. To be thoroughly efficient, the inspection must be steadily maintained, so that possible outbreaks may be foreseen and prevented. In the present instance, as we have already said, the Local Government Board has done all that could be done. They have extended and consolidated the three lines of defence indicated by the lecture we last week published. Already 500 beds are ready for cholera cases, and the number could be increased to 2,000 in a few days if necessary. In short, all preparations have been made in view of a possible invasion, but the Board has done its work quietly and without fuss in order not to cause any needless alarm in the public mind. In the position which it has taken up against quarantine, the Board will have the support of all intelligent sanitarians in this country. Quarantine has been well described by Simon as  an elaborate system of leakage;  it is impossible to make the exclusion of potential sources of infection absolute, and the false security engendered by quarantine makes authorities as well as private persons neglectful of sanitary precautions. Sir Vincent Kennet Barrington has been elected Chairman of the Cholera Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Mr. Shirley Murphy, whose report of the last cholera epidemic has been circulated among the local authorities by the Asylums Board, having offered his advice as medical health officer for the Asylums Board for this occasion, his. offer has been gratefully accepted. An effective ambulance system for the various districts of the metropolis has been provisionally organised, and a quantity of new wheel litters have been ordered to be made for the Board at once.', ''),

This paper proposes FastICA-MARS as a novel data-driven approach for the prediction of the load-displacement performance of uplift-resisting grouted anchors. The hybrid and data-driven FastICA-MARS approach integrates the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique with the FastICA algorithm which is for Independent Component Analysis (ICA). A database of 4315 observations for 479 different anchors from 7 different projects is established. The database is then used to train, validate and compare the FastICA-MARS approach with the classical MARS approach. The developed FastICA-MARS model can provide more accurate predictions than MARS. Moreover, the developed FastICA-MARS model is easy to interpret since the evaluation of the parameter importance of the independent components can be conducted along with the considerations of the correlations with the original variables. It is noteworthy to point out that the grouting pressures play a central role in the proposed model, which is considered of paramount importance in engineering practices but has not been properly taken into account in any prior analytical or empirical predictive models for the load-displacement relationships.', 'Hao Shen, Jinhui Li, Sixin Wang, Zewei Xie');

Robotic exploration missions, starting with Mariner 9, have confirmed that they are composed of water ice. During later missions, instruments such as Mars Global Surveyor\'s MOLA have established a detailed topography and have estimated their depth at about 3 km in the thickest part, while detailed internal structure has been investigated by MARSIS from Mars Express and SHARAD from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. This analysis proposes to establish a base near North Polar Layered Deposits to investigate Mars\' climate, hydrological processes and to test for possible traces of life. The objectives of the mission are to sustain a crew for nine months on the surface of Mars, near the North Pole, and to bring the crew back to Earth safely. During the surface mission, the crew will drill and analyze Polar Layered Deposits in ice samples. Furthermore, because the North Polar region provides an easy access to water ice, this area has the potential of sustaining a long-term human presence. The Mars Polar Research mission shall therefore prepare for long term missions, spanning over multiple crew generations. Indeed, longer duration missions and larger crews should be facilitated by this first mission. This paper describes a mission design for a Mars Polar Research base using systems engineering approach and scenario testing. The goal of the work is to establish a strategy composed of various technologies that have been selected accordingly. The requirements related to crew composition, human physiology and psychology adaptation, quality of communication, challenges and prospects of advancing science, as well as optimum habitat design and its usability, are derived and compiled into mass, volume, data and power consumption. A design for the base and mission scenario is also proposed. Given the identified requirements, possible technologies for life support systems, radiation protection, in-situ propellant production, thermal control, air pressure difference compensation and availability of power are discussed and solutions to focus on are recommended. Furthermore, the requirements for a long-term mission preparation are also identified and solutions to include in a first Mars mission with crew are recommended. In conclusion, approximately 110 metric tons and 160 kW are required to enable a Mars Polar mission with a human crew. A two-phase mission is recommended for enabling the testing of key in-situ resource utilization technologies allowing to minimize mass, while ensuring the security of the crew. The use of optimal payload and fairing, a Mars orbit crane system and deployable structures are recommended. Finally, in preparation for a long-term presence of humans on Mars, including in-situ testing of key technologies enabling the production of consumables facilitating autonomy from Earth is suggested. The consumables that have been identified as not being able to be tested before a first crew is sent to Mars are food and energy production. These developments may serve as priorities for current Mars settlement programs.', 'A. Rüede, A. Ivanov, Claudio Leonardi, Tatiana Volkova'),

Due to the relatively low frequency of these tumors together with their diverse histopathological types, it is not easy to perform a prognosis assessment. Multivariate adaptative regression splines (MARS) is a data mining technique with a well-known ability to describe a response starting from a large number of predictors. In this work, MARS was used for determining the prognosis of cancers of salivary glands using clinical and histological variables, as well as molecular markers. Here, we have generated four different models combining different sets of variables, with sensitivities and specificities ranging from 95.45 to 100%. Specifically, one of these models which combined five clinical variables (Tumor size –T–, neck node metastasis –N–, distant metastasis –M–, age and number of tumor recurrences) plus one molecular factor (gelatinase B -MMP-9-) showed a sensitivity and a specificity of 100%. Therefore, the MARS model was applied to the modeling of the influence of several clinical and molecular variables on the prognosis of salivary gland cancers with success. A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of neural network what was used here to determine a prognostic model composed for four variables: N, M, number of recurrences and tumor type.

Mars is currently an active target in the search for life due to its relative proximity and similarity to Earth, coupled with increasing evidence pointing to the past and present existence of liquid water at the surface and near subsurface [1]. Exchange of rocky impact ejecta between Mars and Earth has been known for at least two decades [2], and evidence has accumulated supporting the hypothesis that living microorganisms embedded in rocks could survive the transfer process [3]. Understanding the ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface martian environment is of prime importance both for life detection and for protection of Mars from forward contamination by human or robotic exploration [4]. The surface environment of Mars presents formidable challenges to life, such as: harsh solar radiation; a scarcity of liquid water and nutrients; extreme low temperatures; and a low-pressure, CO 2-dominated anoxic atmosphere [5]. Recent work in our laboratory has concentrated on investigating the possibility that prokaryotes from Earth could either (i) live on Mars in their current form, or (ii) evolve the ability to live under Mars conditions. Our experiments have involved environmental chambers that can simulate Mars atmospheric conditions of low pressure (P; 0.7 kPa), temperature (T; 0˚C), and a CO 2-dominated anoxic atmosphere (A), called here collectively low-PTA conditions. Growth of permafrost bacteria under low-PTA conditions: Because much of the water on present-day Mars exists in a permanently frozen state mixed with mineral matrix, terrestrial permafrosts are considered to be analogs of the martian environment [6]. We therefore screened Siberian permafrost soils for microbes capable of growing under low-PTA conditions. Using this approach we reported the isolation of 6 Carnobacterium spp. isolates from Siberian permafrost that were capable of low-PTA growth [7]. In addition, a laboratory strain of Serratia liquefaciens was also found to grow under low-PTA conditions [8]. Evolution of Bacillus subtilis to growth at low-P: Previous work had indicated that most bacteria, including the common laboratory strain of B. subtilis, were unable to grow at pressures lower than ~2.5 kPa [9]. To investigate if B. subtilis could evolve the ability to grow at low-P, we cultivated strain WN624 at the', 'W. Nicholson'),

Almost 75% were uploaded by news sources (garnering >20 million views). While only 16% were uploaded by consumers, these videos garnered over 25% of cumulative views (n = 8,581,186 views). The majority of videos mentioned the vaccine manufacturing process (61.0%) and 45.0% speculated on the amount of time needed to have a vaccine ready for use, which most often was thought to be 1–2 years. Even once the biological and technical aspects of vaccine development and manufacturing are accomplished, the benefits conferred on population health will also depend on public willingness to be vaccinated. Ongoing tracking of YouTube is needed to identify what is communicated about vaccines for COVID-19. To the extent that public health officials learn how to create videos about the safety and effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine, which attract viewers, this could help increase awareness and interest about vaccination and help individuals make an informed decision about vaccine uptake.', 'C.

The cocooning strategy limits this risk by vaccinating those likely to interact with the infant and mother during this vulnerable time, such as close friends and family members. Distribution of accurate and accessible vaccine information through existing social networks could be an important tool in increasing vaccine confidence and coverage.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe surveyed 1095 pregnant women from diverse prenatal care practices in Georgia and Colorado. These women were surveyed through a mobile app to assess vaccine intentions, attitudes, beliefs, norms, and levels of trust, and then presented brief individually-tailored educational videos about maternal and infant vaccines and the cocooning strategy. They were then given the opportunity to refer up to six contacts to enroll in the app and receive similar vaccine education.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-eight percent of these women referred at least one contact, with an average of 2.67 contacts per referring woman. Most referrals (93%) were partners, parents, siblings, relatives, or close friends. Attitudinal constructs significantly associated with increased likelihood of referring contacts included: intention to receive maternal influenza vaccine, perceived safety of maternal Tdap vaccine, perceived efficacy of maternal influenza vaccine, perceived susceptibility to and severity of influenza during pregnancy, and trust in vaccine information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and academic institutions. Uncertainty about infant vaccine intentions was associated with decreased likelihood of referring contacts.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPregnant women who valued vaccination and trusted vaccine information from academic institutions were more likely to refer an educational app about vaccines than those who did not. Further research is needed to determine the potential impact of this strategy on vaccine coverage when implemented on a large scale.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nThe survey informing this article was part of a randomized controlled trial funded by the National Institutes of Health [clinicaltrials.gov registration number NCT02898688].', 'M.

Possible effects on piglet welfare should be evaluated. Under field conditions, 135 suckling piglets from 12 litters were vaccinated against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae—64 of those intradermally and 71 intramuscularly, from six litters each. For behavioral analyses, videos were recorded per pen, starting three days before the vaccination and ending three days after the vaccination. In the video analyses, the observation periods 6.00–10.00, 13.00–17.00, and 19.00–21.00 were analysed via scan sampling for the behaviors lying, standing, walking, suckling, and social contact. In the behavioral observations, in all piglets, the most frequent behavior was lying, followed by suckling at the sow’s teats. After vaccination, less lying behavior and more suckling behavior were assessed in intradermally vaccinated piglets compared to intramuscularly vaccinated piglets, which indicates that the piglets were not impaired by stress following vaccination. The results of this study showed that intradermal needle-free vaccination has clear advantages, as it caused fewer vaccination-associated behavior changes in suckling piglets than the intramuscular vaccination method with a needle.', 'M.

Following the steps of the Announcement Approach, participants viewed brief videos of a pediatrician announcing that a child was due for human papillomavirus vaccine (shown to all the parents). In the 2 × 2 experiment, parents saw (1) a video of the pediatrician attempting to ease a concern that the parent had raised earlier in the survey (Ease video), (2) a video of the pediatrician encouraging the parent to get their child vaccinated (Encourage video), (3) both videos, or (4) neither of the videos.

METHODS: Children born at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 1999 and 2016 were followed from 3 months of age until they tested positive for pertussis; disenrolled from Kaiser Permanente Northern California; received the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, adsorbed vaccine; turned 11 years of age, or the end of the study period. DTaP vaccination status was categorized on the basis of the number of doses received in relation to the number of doses expected according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice–recommended ages. RESULTS: Among 469 982 children ages 3 months to 11 years, we identified 738 pertussis cases. A total of 99 cases were unvaccinated, 36 were undervaccinated, 515 were fully vaccinated, and 88 were fully vaccinated plus 1 dose. Pertussis risk was 13 times higher among unvaccinated (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 13.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.64–17.21) compared with fully vaccinated children and 1.9 times higher (aHR = 1.86; 95% CI 1.32–2.63) among undervaccinated children. Among vaccinated children ages 19 to <84 months, pertussis risk was 5 times higher (aHR = 5.04; 95% CI 1.84–13.80) ≥3 years vs <1 year after vaccination. Among children ages 84 to 132 months, risk was 2 times higher (aHR = 2.32; 95% CI 0.97–5.59) ≥6 years vs <3 years after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Undervaccinated and especially unvaccinated children were at greater risk of pertussis. However, most pertussis cases occurred among children age-appropriately vaccinated who were further away from their last DTaP dose, suggesting that suboptimal vaccine effectiveness played a major role in recent pertussis epidemics.', 'O.

Insurance policies typically protect against risks which are triggered only where a business suffers “direct physical loss of, or damage to” property.

For example, at the macro level, the latest cases from epidemiological studies indicate that poorer countries with a lower GDP could potentially have higher mortalities linked to COVID-19 (LloydSherlock et al. 2020). At the micro level, it has already been shown that racial minorities (e.g., Black communities) in the United States have higher rates of infection and death linked to COVID-19 (Laurencin and McClinton 2020). Similarly, in Canada, some have raised concerns about marginalized populations and their higher risk for COVID-19 cases (Jozaghi et al. 2020). We would like to raise concerns towards the risk of COVID-19 infection for sex workers and how the current state of legislation substantially increases this risk. Bill C-36 (the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act) was introduced by the Conservative federal government in 2014, shortly after the earlier decision by the Supreme Court of Canada that found Canada’s prostitution laws unconstitutional. Bill C-36 places sex workers at an increased risk of poor health and safety, as the law prohibits anyone to buy or advertise sexual services (Canada (AG) v Bedford 2013; Department of Justice 2014). This is particularly significant in the current pandemic, as many provinces have ordered massage parlours as well as saunas, spas or similar establishments to shut down (Orton 2020). At the same time, sex workers across Canada are increasingly worried for their personal health, as COVID-19 has caused the closure of many safe locations for work (Wyton 2020). COVID-19 concerns have simultaneously slashed demand, and sex workers’ incomes have been impacted drastically (Wyton 2020). This is particularly significant because sex workers do not qualify for employment insurance or many of the recent governments’ emergency support and rent assistance for individuals, students, seniors, non-profits, smalland medium-sized businesses, sports and culture sectors (Fry 2020). Consequently, sex workers are further marginalized during the current pandemic and are forced to work in risky situations in order to survive and feed their families. For example, out of approximately 2600 sex workers in Vancouver, at least 20% are estimated to be involved in survival sex work, which means they rely on this work to pay for food, rent or the maintenance level of illegal drugs (Canadian Public Health Association 2014). We urge the federal and provincial governments to work with sex work advocacy and harm reduction organizations to provide financial support to sex workers. At the same time, we urge the federal government to amend Bill C-36. As the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, Beverly McLachlin, pointed out, “Parliament has the power to regulate against nuisances, but not at the cost of the health, safety and lives of prostitutes” (Canada (AG) v Bedford 2013, para 11).', 'Ehsan Jozaghi, L.

In this study, we carefully engineered graphene oxide (GO) as a vaccine adjuvant for immunotherapy using urease B (Ure B) as the model antigen. Ure B is a specific antigen for Helicobacter pylori, which is a class I carcinogen for gastric cancer. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and various types of polyethylenimine (PEI) were used as coating polymers. Compared with single-polymer modified GOs (GO-PEG and GO-PEI), certain dual-polymer modified GOs (GO-PEG-PEI) can act as a positive modulator to promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance their cytokine secretion through the activation of multiple toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways while showing low toxicity. Moreover, this GO-PEG-PEI can serve as an antigen carrier to effectively shuttle antigens into DCs. These two advantages enable GO-PEG-PEI to serve as a novel vaccine adjuvant. In the subsequent in vivo experiments, compared with free Ure B and clinically used aluminum-adjuvant-based vaccine (Alum-Ure B), GO-PEG-PEI-Ure B induces stronger cellular immunity via intradermal administration, suggesting promising applications in cancer immunotherapy.

Here, a 3D alginate scaffold embedded with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is proposed as a vaccine delivery platform for in situ long-term activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs). High surface area and hydrophobic surface of the rGO component of the scaffold provide high loading and a very slow release of a loaded antigen, danger signal, and/or chemoattractant from the scaffold. This approach offers long-term bioavailability of the loaded cargo inside the scaffold for manipulation of recruited DCs. After mice are subcutaneously vaccinated with the macroporous alginate graphene scaffold (MAGS) loaded with ovalbumin (OVA) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), this scaffold recruits a significantly high number of DCs, which present antigenic information via major histocompatibility complex class I for a long period. Furthermore, an MAGS loaded with OVA, GM-CSF, and CpG promotes production of activated T cells and memory T cells, leading to the suppression of OVA-expressing B16 melanoma tumor growth in a prophylactic vaccination experiment. This study indicates that an MAGS can be a strong candidate for long-term programming and modulating immune cells in vivo.', 'Arjyabaran Sinha, Y. Choi, M. Nguyen, Thanh Loc Nguyen, S.

F4- and F18-enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) are the most diagnosed causes of PWD. The efficacy of live oral E. coli vaccines has been previously demonstrated on farms with confirmed clinical cases of PWD. However, the impact of vaccination in subclinical cases with mild or not noticeable clinical manifestations needed to be assessed. This study evaluated the effect of an oral dose of a live E. coli bivalent F4/F18 vaccine in nurseries without ongoing clinical PWD outbreaks but with a history of pathogenic E. coli circulating within the herd. Two controlled blinded studies were performed under commercial conditions in a total of 6 European sites. Overall, 1941 vaccinated piglets and 1976 control piglets were enrolled and were monitored for health, growth, and feed conversion rate. Results: No clinical outbreak of ETEC PWD has been observed in the tested farms. Two farms faced episodes of non-ETEC enteric diseases that required treatments. Nursery weight gain was not statistically different between groups in these two farms. However, the nursery weight gain of the vaccinated pigs was significantly higher by 0.80, 0.87 and 1.24 kg than of the control pigs in three of the four farms without non-ETEC enteric diseases (p<0.05) and by 0.69 kg (p=0.051) in the fourth one, leading to numerically heavier pigs at the exit of the four nurseries. No statistically difference was observed for the feed conversion rate, though it was numerically lower for vaccinated pigs of the two tested farms. Conclusions: Recent European legislations aimed at reducing the use of antibiotics and banning therapeutic use of zinc oxide in feed are leading to a search for alternatives to compensate animal health impacts and economic losses due to PWD. These studies demonstrate that, even in the absence of convincing clinical signs of PWD, ETEC infections limit nursery pig optimal growth performance that can be mitigated by vaccination with an oral live E. coli bivalent F4/F18 vaccine. These findings corroborate previous studies showing the effect of vaccination in clinical outbreaks of PWD.', 'É. Nadeau, D. Tremblay, Anna Magdalena Naderer, K. Hellmann'),

Antigen is trapped in the aqueous phase and as the emulsion degrades in vivo the antigen is passively released. DepoVax™ is a unique oil based delivery system that directly suspends the vaccine components in the oil diluent that forces immune cells to actively take up components from the formulation in the absence of passive release. The aim of this study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with additional biological markers to evaluate and understand differences in clearance between several different delivery systems used in peptide-based cancer vaccines.MethodsC57BL/6 mice were implanted with a cervical cancer model and vaccinated 5 days post-implant with either DepoVax (DPX), a water-in-oil emulsion (w/o), a squalene oil-in-water emulsion (squal o/w) or a saponin/liposome emulsion (sap/lip) containing iron oxide-labeled targeted antigen. MRI was then used to monitor antigen clearance, the site of injection, tumour and inguinal lymph node volumes and other gross anatomical changes. HLA-A2 transgenic mice were also vaccinated to evaluate immune responses of human directed peptides.ResultsWe demonstrated differences in antigen clearance between DPX and w/o both in regard to how quickly the antigen was cleared and the pattern in which it was cleared.

Immunol.', 4, 'Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a severe threat to young children and the elderly. Despite decades of research, no vaccine has been approved. Notably, instead of affording protection, a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine induced severe respiratory disease including deaths in vaccinated children in a 1960s clinical trial; however, recent studies indicate that other forms of experimental vaccines can also induce pulmonary pathology in pre-clinical studies. These findings suggest that multiple factors/pathways could be involved in the development of enhanced respiratory diseases. Clearly, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying such adverse reactions is critically important for the development of safe and efficacious vaccines against RSV infection, given the exponential growth of RSV vaccine clinical trials in recent years. By employing an integrated systems biology approach in a pre-clinical cotton rat model, we unraveled a complex network of pulmonary canonical pathways leading to disease development in vaccinated animals upon subsequent RSV infections. Cytokines including IL-1, IL-6 GRO/IL-8, and IL-17 in conjunction with mobilized pulmonary inflammatory cells could play important roles in disease development, which involved a wide range of host responses including exacerbated pulmonary inflammation, oxidative stress, hyperreactivity, and homeostatic imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. Moreover, the observed elevated levels of MyD88 implicate the involvement of this critical signal transduction module as the central node of the inflammatory pathways leading to exacerbated pulmonary pathology. Finally, the immunopathological consequences of inactivated vaccine immunization and subsequent RSV exposure were further substantiated by histological analyses of these key proteins along with inflammatory cytokines, while hypercoagulation was supported by increased pulmonary fibrinogen/fibrin accompanied by reduced levels of plasma D-dimers. Enhanced respiratory disease associated with inactivated RSV vaccine involves a complex network of host responses, resulting in significant pulmonary lesions and clinical manifestations such as tachypnea and airway obstruction. The mechanistic insight into the convergence of different signal pathways and identification of biomarkers could help facilitate the development of safe and effective RSV vaccine and formulation of new targeted interventions.', 'Marsha S.

The present study evaluated the protective effect of intranasal PPRV linage 1 and bacterine vaccinations. Materials and Methods: Twelve West African Dwarf (WAD) goats aged 6 months were randomly grouped and vaccinated within 2 weeks using a combination of PPRV lineage 1 vaccine (Nig/75), and bacterin from Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh) or Pasteurella multocida intranasally. The goats were observed for 3 weeks post-vaccination before comingled with a known infected WAD goat with apparent clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants and further observed clinically for 5 weeks post-infection (PI). Blood samples were taken for hematology while sera were assayed for antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, and superoxide dismutase) activities and pro-oxidants (malondialdehyde content, reduced glutathione, hydrogen peroxide generation, and myeloperoxidase) using spectrophotometric methods. Data were subjected to parametric statistics at α=0.05 using GraphPad Prism version 21. Results: Clinically, there were pyrexia, oculonasal discharge, diarrhea, anemia, leukopenia, and increased pro-oxidants in the unvaccinated goats, while moderate neutrophilia and leukocytosis were observed in PPRV and bacterin vaccinated goats. Two unvaccinated goats were weak and euthanized at 13 and 28 days PI. The goats vaccinated with PPRV and Mh showed better response clinically and biochemically. Conclusion: The mucosal vaccination of goats with PPRV vaccine and bacterine will protect against exposure and culminate in the development of protective mucosal, humoral, and cell-mediated immune responses.

It is widely accepted that the appropriate immune response is characterised by a T-helper (Th)1-dominated profile in an overall mixed Th1/Th2 response. The absence of a strong Th1 response is associated with progression to the clinical disease. Thus, there is a need for an effective vaccine that could modulate the immune response to a more appropriate profile against the parasite. In this study we measured the impact of the LiESP/QA-21 canine vaccine, recently launched commercially in Europe, on selected humoral and cellular immune markers for one year after a primary vaccination course. The humoral response to vaccination was characterised by a predominantly IgG2 profile. Vaccinated dogs developed long-lasting cell-mediated immune responses against L. infantum, specifically with a stronger ability of macrophages to reduce intracellular parasite burdens in co-culture with autologous lymphocytes compared to control dogs (p=0.0002), which was correlated with induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and production of nitric oxide (NO) derivatives.

Exploring the biodistribution of vaccine components may be key to understanding this action. This work used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize the in vivo biodistribution of the antigen and oil substrate of the vaccine delivery system known as DepoVax(TM). DepoVax uses a novel adjuvanted lipid-in-oil based formulation to solubilise antigens and promote a depot effect. In this study, antigen or oil were tagged with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), making them visible on MR images. This enables tracking of individual vaccine components to determine changes in biodistribution. Mice were injected with SPIO-labeled antigen or SPIO-labeled oil, and imaged to examine clearance of labeled components from the vaccine site. The SPIO-antigen was steadily cleared, with nearly half cleared within two months post-vaccination. In contrast, the SPIO-oil remained relatively unchanged. The biodistribution of the SPIO-antigen component within the vaccine site was heterogeneous, indicating the presence of active clearance mechanisms, rather than passive diffusion or drainage. Mice injected with SPIO-antigen also showed MRI contrast for several weeks post-vaccination in the draining inguinal lymph node. These results indicate that MRI can visualize the in vivo longitudinal biodistribution of vaccine components. The sustained clearance is consistent with antigen up-take and trafficking by immune cells, leading to accumulation in the draining lymph node, which corresponds to the sustained immune responses and reduced tumor burden observed in vaccinated mice.', 'K.

Two common methods of tumor lysate preparations are freeze-thaw processing and UVB irradiation to induce necrosis and apoptosis, respectively. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) oxidation is a new method for inducing primary necrosis and enhancing the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Experimental Design: We compared the ability of DCs to engulf three different tumor lysate preparations, produce T-helper 1 (TH1)-priming cytokines and chemokines, stimulate mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR), and finally elicit T-cell responses capable of controlling tumor growth in vivo. Results: We showed that DCs engulfed HOCl-oxidized lysate most efficiently stimulated robust MLRs, and elicited strong tumor-specific IFN-γ secretions in autologous T cells. These DCs produced the highest levels of TH1-priming cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-12. Mice vaccinated with HOCl-oxidized ID8-ova lysate–pulsed DCs developed T-cell responses that effectively controlled tumor growth. Safety, immunogenicity of autologous DCs pulsed with HOCl-oxidized autologous tumor lysate (OCDC vaccine), clinical efficacy, and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated in a pilot study of five subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer. OCDC vaccination produced few grade 1 toxicities and elicited potent T-cell responses against known ovarian tumor antigens. Circulating regulatory T cells and serum IL-10 were also reduced. Two subjects experienced durable PFS of 24 months or more after OCDC. Conclusions: This is the first study showing the potential efficacy of a DC vaccine pulsed with HOCl-oxidized tumor lysate, a novel approach in preparing DC vaccine that is potentially applicable to many cancers.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) can cause harm to the skin; however, little is known on inconveniences of face masks wearing. This study was undertaken to analyze the most bothersome issues reported by young people using face protection during current viral pandemic. The survey was created with Google Forms and posted on Facebook groups for students in Poland. The recall period was the last 7 days. The data were collected in 48 hours (April 12-14, 2020). At that time wearing face masks in Poland was not mandatory. A number of 2315 answers were received, 8 questionnaires were removed (incompleteness of data). Out of 2307 responders, 1393 (60.4%) declared face masks wearing. As 517 (37.1%) participants used several types of face masks, they were excluded, and finally, 876 questionnaires were considered. The age of the group was 18-27 years. The responses were downloaded for statistical analysis (Statistica 13; Statsoft, Tulsa, Oklahoma). Out of 876 participants, only 27 people (3.1%) did not complain of any problems related to face mask wearing. Out of all reported inconveniences, difficulty in breathing appeared to the most common one (35.9%), followed by warming/sweating (21.3%), misting up of the glasses (21.3%), and slurred speech (12.3%). Interestingly, other skin bothersome reactions related to wearing of face masks were reported less often (itch—7.7%, skin irritation—0.9%). Difficulties in wearing the glasses and limited visibility were rarely reported (0.3% each). In the model of logistic regression analysis, we found that wearing surgical masks among the other types of masks showed significantly lower risk for the development of most common bothersome issues, as difficulty in breathing, warming/sweating, glasses misting up, slurred speech, and itch (odds ratio [OR] = 0.42, 0.60, 0.10, 0.17, and 0.04, respectively). In contrast, cloth masks use was related to higher risk of difficulty in breathing (OR = 1.56), warming/sweating (OR = 1.31), glasses misting up (OR = 1.92), slurred speech (OR = 1.86), and itch (OR = 2.99). Respirators were found to be at increased risk only for glasses misting up (OR = 1.65) (Table 1). Adverse reactions to PPE were mostly reported in health care workers (HCW). Foo et al during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 found that face rash appeared in 35.8% and itch in 51.4% of HCW wearing the professional face protection. Recently, authors from China pointed out that 17.1% of HCW developed adverse reactions of respiratory tract due to face mask use. Skin reactions were quite common, including among others, itch (14.9%), redness/erythema (12.6%), rash (12.4%), xerosis (11.6%) burning (3.7%), and pain/prickling (3.2%). To the best of our knowledge, we presented for the first time a real life data on the most bothersome aspects of face mask use within general public. We documented that wearing surgical masks was linked to significantly lower risk of adverse reactions. This is supported by Roberge et al, who postulated that surgical mask use at low-moderate work rate was not associated with clinically significant physiological impact. However, some participants complained on skin irritation (11%), moisture build up (11%), sticking to the skin (11%), significant face warmth (26%), and pinching (7%). During the viral pandemics due to shortage of medically graded masks, cloth masks became more popular. Although there is no enough strong evidence the cloth masks may be only slightly less effective than surgical masks in blocking emission of particles. They are thought to be 5-fold more effective than not wearing face protection.

The use of surgical masks has been recommended in healthcare settings to minimize pathogen transmission between patients with CF. Objectives: To determine if face masks and cough etiquette reduce viable P. aeruginosa aerosolized during coughing. Methods: Twenty‐five adults with CF and chronic P. aeruginosa infection were recruited. Participants performed six talking and coughing maneuvers, with or without face masks (surgical and N95) and hand covering the mouth when coughing (cough etiquette) in an aerosol‐sampling device. An Andersen Cascade Impactor was used to sample the aerosol at 2 meters from each participant. Quantitative sputum and aerosol bacterial cultures were performed, and participants rated the mask comfort levels during the cough maneuvers. Measurements and Main Results: During uncovered coughing (reference maneuver), 19 of 25 (76%) participants produced aerosols containing P. aeruginosa, with a positive correlation found between sputum P. aeruginosa concentration (measured as cfu/ml) and aerosol P. aeruginosa colony‐forming units. There was a reduction in aerosol P. aeruginosa load during coughing with a surgical mask, coughing with an N95 mask, and cough etiquette compared with uncovered coughing (P < 0.001). A similar reduction in total colony‐forming units was observed for both masks during coughing; yet, participants rated the surgical masks as more comfortable (P = 0.013). Cough etiquette provided approximately half the reduction of viable aerosols of the mask interventions during voluntary coughing. Talking was a low viable aerosol‐producing activity. Conclusions: Face masks reduce cough‐generated P. aeruginosa aerosols, with the surgical mask providing enhanced comfort. Cough etiquette was less effective at reducing viable aerosols.', 'M.

The purpose of this work was to propose a methodology for the automatic assessment of the quality of health-related news stories using natural language processing and machine learning. Materials and Methods: We used a database from the website HealthNewsReview.org that aims to improve the public dialogue about health care. HealthNewsReview.org developed a set of criteria to critically analyze health care interventions\' claims. In this work, we attempt to automate the evaluation process by identifying the indicators of those criteria using natural language processing-based machine learning on a corpus of more than 1,300 news stories. We explored features ranging from simple n-grams to more advanced linguistic features and optimized the feature selection for each task. Additionally, we experimented with the use of pre-trained natural language model BERT. Results: For some criteria, such as mention of costs, benefits, harms, and “disease-mongering,” the evaluation results were promising with an F1 measure reaching 81.94%, while for others the results were less satisfactory due to the dataset size, the need of external knowledge, or the subjectivity in the evaluation process. Conclusion: These used criteria are more challenging than those addressed by previous work, and our aim was to investigate how much more difficult the machine learning task was, and how and why it varied between criteria. For some criteria, the obtained results were promising; however, automated evaluation of the other criteria may not yet replace the manual evaluation process where human experts interpret text senses and make use of external knowledge in their assessment.', 'Majed M.

The use of superlatives—“an exaggerated or hyperbolical expression of praise”1—is particularly consequential. Superlatives used to describe health information in online news articles may contribute to a widespread misunderstanding about the effectiveness of a treatment. As there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), readers of articles that perpetuate such hype may be deceived and given false hopes. For example, alternative therapies are touted as cures for AD. “Coral” calcium supplements are one such example. The Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) filed complaints against the company promoting this supplement stating these claims were unlawful due to unreliable evidence.2 Furthermore, some “promising” therapies for ADmay generate similar unnecessary excitement. Clinical trials of aducanumab, a drug targeting amyloid plaques, were halted due to failed futility analysis; recently, it was reintroduced in phase III trials based on new analysis.3 These early difficulties in clinical trials raise the question if aducanumab should be revered as a “breakthrough” in the news media before clinical trials are completed. These illustrations suggest the need for research exploring the use of exaggerated language regarding AD therapies. Here, we evaluate the use of superlatives exaggerating AD treatments and other characteristics of news articles.', 'Benjamin Heigle, Ali Khan, Ryan Ottwell, M. Vassar'),

Most social platforms today rely on users\' voluntary reports to determine which news stories to fact-check first. Despite the importance, no prior work has explored the potential biases in such a reporting process. This work proposes a novel methodology to assess how users perceive truth or misinformation in online news stories. By conducting a large-scale survey (N = 15,000), we identify the possible biases in news perceptions and explore how partisan leanings influence the news selection algorithm for fact checking. Our survey reveals several perception biases or inaccuracies in estimating the truth level of stories. The first kind, called the total perception bias (TPB), is the aggregate difference in the ground truth and perceived truth level. The next two are the false-positive bias (FPB) and false-negative bias (FNB), which measures users\' gullibility and cynicality of a given claim. We also propose ideological mean perception bias (IMPB), which quantifies a news story\'s ideological disputability. Collectively, these biases indicate that user perceptions are not correlated with the ground truth of new stories; users believe some stories to be more false and vice versa. This calls for the need to fact-check news stories that exhibit the most considerable perception biases first, which the current voluntary reporting does not offer. Based on these observations, we propose a new framework that can best leverage users\' truth perceptions to remove false stories, correct misperceptions of users, or decrease ideological disagreements. We discuss how this new prioritizing scheme can aid platforms to significantly reduce the impact of fake news on user beliefs.', 'Mahmoudreza Babaei, Juhi Kulshrestha, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Elissa M.

In response, these sites are encouraging their users to report any news story they encounter on the site, which they perceive as fake. Stories that are reported as fake by a large number of users are prioritized for fact checking by (human) experts at fact checking organizations like Snopes and PolitiFact. Thus, social media sites today are relying on their users\' perceptions of the truthfulness of news stories to select stories to fact check. However, few studies have focused on understanding how users perceive truth in news stories, or how biases in their perceptions might affect current strategies to detect and label fake news stories. To this end, we present an in-depth analysis on users\' perceptions of truth in news stories. Specifically, we analyze users\' truth perception biases for 150 stories fact checked by Snopes. Based on their ground truth and the truth value perceived by users, we can classify the stories into four categories -- (i) C1: false stories perceived as false by most users, (ii) C2: true stories perceived as false by most users, (iii) C3: false stories perceived as true by most users, and (iv) C4: true stories perceived as true by most users. The stories that are likely to be reported (flagged) for fact checking are from the two classes C1 and C2 that have the lowest perceived truth levels. We argue that there is little to be gained by fact checking stories from C1 whose truth value is correctly perceived by most users. Although stories in C2 reveal the cynicality of users about true stories, social media sites presently do not explicitly mark them as true to resolve the confusion. On the contrary, stories in C3 are false stories, yet perceived as true by most users. Arguably, these stories are more damaging than C1 because the truth values of the the story in former situation is incorrectly perceived while truth values of the latter is correctly perceived. Nevertheless, the stories in C1 is likely to be fact checked with greater priority than the stories in C3! In fact, in today\'s social media sites, the higher the gullibility of users towards believing a false story, the less likely it is to be reported for fact checking. In summary, we make the following contributions in this work. 1. Methodological: We develop a novel method for assessing users\' truth perceptions of news stories. We design a test for users to rapidly assess (i.e., at the rate of a few seconds per story) how truthful or untruthful the claims in a news story are. We then conduct our truth perception tests on-line and gather truth perceptions of 100 US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk workers for each story. 2. Empirical: Our exploratory analysis of users\' truth perceptions reveal several interesting insights. For instance, (i) for many stories, the collective wisdom of the crowd (average truth rating) differs significantly from the actual truth of the story, i.e., wisdom of crowds is inaccurate, (ii) across different stories, we find evidence for both false positive perception bias (i.e., a gullible user perceiving the story to be more true than it is in reality) and false negative perception bias (i.e., a cynical user perceiving a story to be more false than it is in reality), and (iii) users\' political ideologies influence their truth perceptions for the most controversial stories, it is frequently the result of users\' political ideologies influencing their truth perceptions. 3. Practical: Based on our observations, we call for prioritizing stories to fact check in order to achieve the following three important goals: (i) Remove false news stories from circulation, (ii) Correct the misperception of the users, and (iii) Decrease the disagreement between different users\' perceptions of truth. Finally, we provide strategies which utilize users\' truth perceptions (and predictive analysis of their biases) to achieve the three goals stated above while prioritizing stories for fact checking.

And if so, how does it work? A popular eye drop ‘Can-C’ containing N-alpha-acetylcarnosine (NAC) claims to reduce, reverse and slow the development of senile cataract. It was developed and is patented by Professor Babizhayev, a biophysicist and Executive Director of Innovative Vision Products (IVP) [1]. In a separate book by Marios Kyriazis – an anti-aging physician expert, NAC is hailed as “The Cataract Cure” and is also the title of his book that briefly explains the miracle of NAC in relation to research by Babizhayev [2]. The author explains that NAC is a free radical scavenger and blocker of cross-linking, a process whereby glycated proteins bind with other proteins and form large insoluble amounts of damaged protein that can accumulate in and disrupt the natural arrangement of the lens crystallin fibres. NAC is closely related in its molecular structure to its active form L-carnosine that it transforms to on entering the lens. It is able to do so as NAC is resistant to degradation within the aqueous humour by the enzyme carnosinase [2]. IVP claims to produce a unique purified formula of NAC through a specific (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) cGMP process in Japan which is then incorporated in its ‘Can-C’ drop which contains 1% of NAC, de-ionised water, 1% glycerine and 0.3% carboxymethylcellulose which act as lubricants and stabilisers, 0.3% benzyl alcohol as preservative and potassium bicarbonate and potassium borate as buffering agents [3]. The drops are available online, two 15ml vials cost £19.70 on Amazon Prime. The recommended dose is one to two drops twice a day for four to six months, after which the user is expected to taper the regime to two drops once a day on the assumption that they have noticed a difference [4]. Babizhayev has conducted the majority of the research on the use of NAC in animals and humans. In particular, his study from 2002 aimed to test the efficacy of NAC in the treatment of cataracts in humans via a randomised, placebo-controlled trial, that was carried out in 49 subjects of which there were 76 eyes affected by cataracts [5]. Their outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), degree of cataract via stereocinematographic slit-images and retro-illumination, as well as degree of glare sensitivity. Their results suggested that patients who were treated with the NAC drops had shown improvement across the board compared to the patients who did not receive the treatment. Nevertheless, this study can be criticised in several ways. Firstly, there was no mention of blinding of the investigators in the methodology or analysis of results. Secondly, the follow-up time is inconsistent as some participants were followed up to six months whilst others up to two years. Additionally, not everyone in the control group received placebo as some of them received no treatment. There is also the glaring conflict of interest as the author is linked to the company that produces the NAC drops. My disappointment seemed to be echoed by a Cochrane review by Dubois and Bastawrous in 2017 on the effectiveness of NAC drops to prevent or reverse age-related cataract [6]. Unsurprisingly, the authors only managed to identify two potentially eligible studies, conducted by none other than by Babizhayev, in 2002 and 2004. However, both studies remain unclassified as there was insufficient information on their design and methodology. It is thus reasonable to inform your patient that whilst there is seemingly no harm in trying NAC-containing drops to ‘dissolve’ their cataracts, there is no research evidence to prove that it is effective. NAC isn’t the only compound implicated as a potential agent to reverse and ‘dissolve’ cataracts, as shown by Zhao et al. in 2015 [7]. They discovered mutations in lanosterol synthase (LSS) that contributed to congenital cataracts in three children from a consanguineous Caucasian family. LSS synthesises lanosterol which is naturally occurring in the lens as an amphipathic molecule, i.e. it is both hydrophilic and hydrophobic. In Zhao’s in vitro study, lens tissues from rabbits were immersed in solution of lanosterol for six days in the dark at room temperature; whilst in the in vivo study, dogs’ eyes received intravitreal injections of lanosterol loaded nanoparticles as well as topical lanosterol drops and the outcomes were measured six weeks later. The degree of cataract assessed by lens clarity before and after the treatment periods was assessed by blinded examiners using an opacification grading system. They found a statistically significant reduction in cataract severity and improvement in lens clarity post-treatment in both studies. They concluded that lanosterol inhibits lens protein aggregation by coating the hydrophobic core areas of large protein aggregates within the lens, thus rendering them water-soluble which improves their clarity. Shanmugam et al. attempted to replicate Zhao’s success in human lenses by extracting 40 human senile cataractous nuclei via small incision manual cataract surgery and randomly immersing half of them in a lanosterol solution of the exact concentration as in the rabbit study, and the other half in a control solution for six days [8]. Unfortunately they discovered a worsening degree of cataract in both the treatment and control group as graded by masked observers. As there was no lens capsule or cortex in Shanmugam’s study due to their nuclei extraction method they argue that lanoserol should have easier access to the lens fibres, however, this was not the case. They postulated several reasons for this, one of which could be due to difference in concentration of lanosterol needed for reversal of protein aggregation in human lenses. Also, other compounds besides lanosterol could be contributing towards cataract formation. And so it appears that, for the time being, cataract surgery remains the only option for improving vision in patients with lens opacification. It is not only the most common operation performed in the NHS but also one of the oldest known surgical procedures that has evolved from couching to phacoemulsification.', ''),

Editorial Comment: It is a little hard to tell whether patients in the Jacobs article included patients from the Bresler article (the senior/second author is the same in both) and, if so, one is an extension of the other. Both come to the same conclusion, suggesting that bacteria may not be related to interstitial cystitis/painful bladder symptomatology (IC/PBS). The Bresler article included a midstream voided specimen collected from 21 affected patients and 20 asymptomatic controls. Identification was performed using 16SrRNA gene sequencing and EQUC (Enhanced Quantitative Urine Culture), a validated enhanced urine culture approach. The Jacobs article enrolled 49 patients with IC/PBS and 40 controls, and all provided catheterized urine samples, and a subset provided voided and catheterized specimens. All samples were assessed by EQUC, and a subset was assessed by 16SrRNA gene sequencing. The authors conclude, “We did not find an undetected/dominant uropathogen that could revolutionize the treatment of IC/PBS, but we did make interesting observations. The [female urinary microbiota] of women with IC/PBS determined by catheterized urine and analyzed with EQUC and 16SrRNA gene sequencing does not differ from controls. The presence of Lactobacillus is unlikely associated with symptom severity, and Candida does not seem to be a major contributor to IC/PBS . The disease process is generally independent of microbes.” Possible weaknesses, which the authors mention, are small but statistically significant difference in age, the lack of menopause matching, nonexclusion of patients on oral or vaginal hormones and nonexclusion of patients with recent intercourse. The authors also conclude that results from the paired catheterized vs voided samples showed that voided urine does not accurately represent bladder microbiota. They demonstrate that using voided samples to describe the bladder microbiome would lead to a significantly elevated false-positive rate. Exclusion criteria for the Jacobs study consisted of vaginal itching/burning/discharge, urinary retention, recurrent urinary infections, history of bladder cancer or pelvic radiation, history of neurological disease, and history of having received or performed in the previous 4 weeks antibiotics, vaginal douching or vaginal probiotics, or bladder instrumentation or intravesical therapy. However, no other treatments were considered as part of the exclusion criteria, nor was this information explicitly gathered. Although it seems unlikely, these are also possible confounders. Alan J.

A novel polysaccharide, named HAW1-1, was pooled by DEAE Sepharose™ Fast Flow column and further purified by Sephacryl S-100 HR column. The molecular weight of HAW1-1 was 42.35 kDa. The carbohydrate content of HAW1-1 was 99.42% and no protein was detected. The monosaccharide analysis showed this polysaccharide was only composed of glucose. According to the partial acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis and NMR spectra, the backbone of HAW1-1 was consisted of 1,4-linked α-D-glucan and 1,4,6-linked α-D-glucan. The side chains were composed of 1,6-linked α-D-glucan and terminal-linked α-D-glucan. The bioactivity tests showed that HAW1-1 could promote the growth of three species of intestinal Bacteroides and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

What is the potential impact of the Amazon wildfires on vector-borne and zoonotic emerging diseases? - A statement from an international experts meeting.', '2019', 'Travel medicine and infectious disease', 25, 'According to recent scientific evidence, Brazil\'s wildfires are linked to deforestation. The blazes are surging in a pattern typical of forest clearing, along the edges of the agricultural frontiers (Fig. 1). Historical data shows the pattern of events: chainsaws or excavators open the way, then the wildfires, and these are followed by livestock, monoculture, or other forms of economic activity [1]. By August 24th, 2019, Brazil\'s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) had counted more than 76,000 wildfire spots in the Brazilian Amazon, compared with 22,000 in the same period last year. The Global wildfire Emissions Database project, which includes scientists from NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; the University of California, Irvine; and Vrije University in Amsterdam, sees the same trend, although the numbers are slightly higher [1]. The situation, especially ecologically, is critical. Brazil contains about 60% of the Amazon, the largest rainforest in the world. Several million plants, animal and insect species live in the Amazon, in addition to dwellers, and the Amazon acts as an enormous carbon sink that helps to cool global temperatures, of utmost importance in the context of climate change and global warming [2]. Forest wildfires (Fig. 1), in this scenario, release this stored carbon, causing a major impact on health. For example, high air pollution immediately. The long-term impact is more considerable and challenging to estimate. The effects will be determined by the type of change in the ecosystem (landscape, fauna, flora, environment) [3,4]. During the period August 16th-17th, 2019, a group of international experts held a meeting on Zoonoses and One Health, in Pereira, Colombia, under the auspices and networking of the Colombian Association of Infectious Diseases and its Committee on Tropical Medicine, Zoonoses and Travel Medicine. This group has analyzed the situation in Brazil and set a position regarding the potential impact of the 2019 Amazon wildfires (Fig. 1) on vector-borne and zoonotic emerging diseases. The forest wildfire produces a sharp change of the landscape, from a tropical forest, characteristically humid; it changes towards a dry one, typical of deforestation. Previous studies have shown that landscape change, and primary deforestation, alters multiple ecological elements, e.g. phytotelmata habitat availability and mosquito production, as has been observed in the Peruvian Amazon with increasing rates of vectorborne disease transmission. Studies report that deforestation increases the risk of malaria and probably other vector-transmitted infections [5]. The ecologies of multiple transmissions of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases pose challenges for their control, especially in changing landscapes, even more during such deforestation situations [6]. After deforestation has occurred, the landscape will be modified to facilitate economic activities. Land-use changes can impact infectious disease transmission by increasing spatial overlap between people and wildlife disease reservoirs. Previous epidemics like the sizeable yellow fever epidemic, which began in Brazil in 2016 and had as vectors the Haemagogus leucocelaenus and H. janthinomys, which are wild mosquitoes [7], have been driven by landscape modifications, with forest fragments running in periurban areas, allowing enough interaction to produce such an epidemic [3,4]. Additionally, the Amazon region of Brazil, endemic for many communicable or zoonotic diseases, can, after a wildfire, can trigger a selection for survival, and with it change the habitat and behaviors of some animal species. These can be reservoirs of zoonotic bacteria, viruses, and parasites, that can adapt to suburban and urban landscapes and would increase the risk of interaction and infection leading to the emergence of diseases in new areas [8,9]. For example, with regard to the arenaviruses and hantaviruses, in rodent hosts, their geographical distribution may change, with the potential risk of increasing and representing a threat to humans [10]. Other hosts, such as birds could also transport pathogens. The situation could also help hosts to propagate diseases like Oropouche virus, a zoonotic arbovirus in which birds play an essential role maintaining sylvatic cycles [11], previously reported in areas surrounding the wildfires [12].

They have attracted new attention since the increasing antibiotic resistance developed into a global crisis. Phage therapy, a 100-year-old form of antibacterial treatment in medicine, is gaining momentum because phages represent a therapy concept without such negative side effects as toxicity; phages are the only therapeutic agent that regulates itself at the sites of infection and decays when the infectious bacteria have been killed. Nature is an almost infinite phage resource: New ones can be isolated for most kinds of problem bacteria as needed; bacteria and their phages constantly co-evolve. This is important as new pathogenic bacterial variants evolve and new challenging situations arise. In human therapy, “cocktails” of multiple phages may reduce the probability of selecting bacteria that developed resistance to a certain phage. Antibiotic agents can be applied together with phages in many circumstances; the two often function synergistically. Phages cannot be expected to replace antibiotic agents in our medical arsenal, but can be used where antibiotic agents fail. The selected phages, however, must be obligately virulent, well-characterized, and highly purified before application. Countless patients and their physicians are waiting for re-establishing phage therapy as a flexible, tailored medicine; infrastructures should be built in all countries urgently: The 2015 World Health Organization assembly resolution 68.7.3. called for national action plans by May 2017 to combat the antimicrobial drug resistance crisis.

Consequently, phages may be employed in a number of technologies relevant to medicine and public health. As discussed in this chapter, these technologies include phage use as antibacterial agents (phage therapy); vaccines (both DNA and subunit); selectively cytotoxic complexes, including as anti-cancer agents; gene therapy vectors; bacterial identification and detection agents; and a means of discovery of small-molecule antibacterials.

However, we know little about E-E’s potential to improve outcomes for minority groups, despite the fact minority group members are also exposed to media stereotypes about their group.

Specifically, I exposed Asian American participants (N=259) to videos featuring either ingroup members with a Culturally-Specific narrative (i.e., relevant to Asian American identity), ingroup and outgroup members with a Universal narrative (i.e., culturally-irrelevant), and no ingroup members as a Control (i.e., featuring only White Americans). Further, videos either displayed low or high virality metrics (i.e., views, likes, and comments). After video exposure, participants rated their perceptions of the videos (identification with the featured individuals, videos’ societal impact), identity self-perceptions (ethnic self-esteem, metacognitive bicultural identity integration [BII], national belonging), and civic outcomes (agency and behavior). I found that participants reported greater identification with the Culturally-Specific videos compared to the Universal and Control videos. Further, contrary to predictions, participants perceived the Culturally-Specific and Control videos as having greater societal impact than the Universal videos, and the Control videos elicited the greatest feelings of civic agency.

I found that the Culturally-Specific videos elicited the greatest warmth/liking toward Asian Americans compared to the Universal and Control videos, and the Universal videos elicited greater reactance within the low virality conditions. Further, participants who watched the Culturally-Specific videos reported greater knowledgeability about Asian Americans compared to those in the Control condition.

Despite the fact that a lot of research and development has gone in the past decade to develop robust encryption algorithms, hackers have managed to break them. Effective information security is an important aspect and cannot be undermined in today\'s times. When an adversary intercepts encrypted data, it can be known that a secret message was sent. This can raise alarms and invite attacks. Moreover, many times it is important to communicate secretly without drawing any attention and not raise suspicion even if the message is intercepted. We feel that the key to heightened security is to not only encrypt the data but to hide the fact that secret message is being sent. This is implemented by steganography. Steganography is the science of concealing information (secret message) in an apparently innocuous media file (image, audio, video). We use an algorithm to hide the message inside the carrier (cover) media. Although steganography facilitates covert communication, it suffers from attacks like detection, modification, extraction and destruction. In this paper, we present a powerful combination of steganography and cryptography — a novel method to realize a highly secured level of communication. The proposed system encrypts the secret message via secure encryption algorithms and spreads it out over a broad bandwidth using spread spectrum technique. Then, we embed it into the cover media without affecting the perceptual fidelity as the amount of encoded information is below the threshold of perception and is regarded as noise. The original video is available at the receiver for successful retrieval of the secret message. This paper achieves additional security layer of data authentication and integrity check by adding a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) module to the message. Further, we analyze the performance of the proposed technique towards different detection, modification and destruction attacks. The proposed blend of techniques showcases a higher immunity to these attacks while maintaining private, confidential communication.

He was not heard. Within weeks the unthinkable became reality and a pandemic evolved and took its path around the globe. What sounded initially like a harmless flu, and then suddenly arose as a Black Swan to the many unprepared, was an expected event to virologists and to philanthropists such as Bill Gates. As such, Nassim Taleb who popularized the term introduced by Sir Karl Popper almost a century ago refused to call it a Black Swan. Many national healthcare systems were not well prepared for such an event: disinfectant and masks were lacking, there were not enough hospital beds or intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators were scarce. All things that costed many lives— for sure, the austerity politics did not pay off in healthcare as it killed many, indeed too many in affected countries. For cardiologists, the pandemic was indeed a Black Swan as the vast majority had never dealt with viruses or epidemics (with the exception of a few interested in myocarditis). As it turned out, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) became the major risk factors for an unfortunate course of the pulmonary infection and a major cause of death in affected patients. Within weeks, CVDs came to centre stage in the pandemic, as outlined in a Viewpoint ‘Coronaviruses and the cardiovascular system: acute and long-term implications’ by Bernard Prendergast et al. from the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, UK. The authors remind us that much has been learnt in the course of preceding epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and H1N1 influenza, and it is now recognized that their overall health burden may be underestimated, since extrapulmonary manifestations are frequent. Acute and chronic cardiovascular complications of pneumonia are common and result from various mechanisms, including relative ischaemia, systemic inflammation, and pathogen-mediated damage including myocarditis. Of note, influenza vaccination reduces major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary disease. Thus, the COVID-19 outbreak emphasizes the need for greater awareness of the acute and long-term cardiovascular implications of viral infections and the significant gaps in knowledge that future research will need to address for the benefit of such patients. In a second Viewpoint entitled ‘SARS-CoV-2: should inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system be withdrawn in patients with COVID-19?’, Gabriela Kuster et al. from the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland discuss the hypothesis that angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) could foster cell entry of the COVID-19 virus and in turn provide a risk factor for fatal outcomes due to up-regulation of ACE2 that the virus uses to dock on the cell membrane (Figure 1). The authors discuss the knowns and unknowns regarding the renin–angiotensin system, ACE-Is, and SARS-CoV-2 interaction, and provide two interpretations, i.e. (1) a possible negative impact as ACE-Is (which in the meantime appears unlikely)in spite of the well established protective effects of the agentsor (2) reverse causality since patients on ACE-Is are commonly older and have more comorbidities. A Brief Communication entitled ‘Cell type-specific expression of the putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in human hearts’, Stefanie Dimmeler et al. from the Johan-Wolfgang Goethe Universität in Frankfurt am Main, Germany continue on the subject. They determined the tissue levels of ACE2 where SARS-CoV-2 binds via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins. They found that ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung and heart, complementing previous observations that it is increased in myocardial infarction. Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells, it can also cause myocardial injury, as assessed by increased troponin T and NT-proBNP levels in COVID-19-infected patients, as further outlined in this issue. The current pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects elderly individuals, especially men and those with CVD who are often receiving ACE-Is. In their manuscript ‘Circulating plasma concentrations of ACE2 in men and women with heart failure and effects of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone-inhibitors: potential implications for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2infected patients’ Adriaan Voors and colleagues from the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands expand on this issue with heart failure patients.

The P2X7R is an ATP gated ion channel, expressed by most immune cells, including the monocyte‐derived cell lineages, T and B lymphocytes and their precursors. Here we give an overview of recent and established literature on the role of P2X7R in septic and sterile inflammation. P2X7R ability in restraining intracellular bacteria and parasite infection by modulation of the immune response are described, with particular focus on Mycobacteria and Plasmodium. Emerging literature on the role of P2X7 in viral infections such as HIV‐1 is also briefly covered. Finally, we describe the numerous intracellular pathways related to inflammation and activated by the P2X7R, including the NLRP3 inflammasome, NF‐kB, NFAT, GSK3&bgr; and VEGF, and discuss the involvement of P2X7R in chronic diseases. The possible therapeutic applications of P2X7R antagonists are also described.', 'E. Adinolfi, A. Giuliani, Elena De Marchi, A. Pegoraro, Elisa Orioli, F. Di Virgilio'),

In it, he told Goldwater, “I have nothing this morning but the deepest contempt” for you and other congressional Republicans. Two days earlier Goldwater and other GOP leaders on Capitol Hill met with Nixon and made it clear to him that if he did not resign he would be impeached. “President Nixon should have had the support of all Republicans,” continued Avery. “It is you who should have resigned, not him.” Although Avery had voted for Goldwater for president in 1964, he now regretted the decision and hoped “none of you [congressional Republicans] are ever reelected.”1 Avery was not alone in supporting Nixon. While a large majority of Americans came to believe he was guilty and should not continue in office, millions of Americans, roughly a quarter of the population, steadfastly defended the president throughout Watergate.2 In the end, Nixon loyalists could not save the president, but this article argues that their strident defense of Nixon influenced the way in which congressional Republicans responded to Watergate and thus helped to shape its trajectory and outcome.', 'M.

In 2016, Donald Trump took the White House without winning the popular vote. This had only happened four times previously in US history. This November, all eyes were again on the Electoral College system that decides the president based on votes from each state. Counting Electoral College votes once again was a major part of the drama. Early counts indicated the possibility that incumbent President Trump could once again defy the odds and win the Electoral College in 2020, despite losing the popular vote. As soon as ballot boxes were open it was clear that the races in key states such as Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin would be very tight. But this time around, the Democratic challenger Joe Biden, managed to flip a number of states won by Trump in 2016 to take the White House. Biden’s overall winning margin in the popular vote was much larger than that of Hillary Clinton last time out. At the time of writing, less than a week after polls closed, Biden’s lead in the popular vote stands at more than four million, or over six per cent ahead of the total vote. Although it took four tense days for Biden’s majority in the Electoral College to be confirmed, the Democrat’s lead in the popular vote never seemed at risk. With an unprecedentedly high voter participation, both candidates ended up with unusually high voter numbers, resulting in Biden becoming the President with the largest number of votes in US history. Trump responded to the prospect of defeat by announcing a series of legal challenges. Few experts gave these initiatives much chance of success, but they could slightly alter the eventual final results. The maps in this article were therefore produced with a certain degree of caution. While the overall outcome is unlikely to change, there may be minor shifts in the vote distribution. However, as long as this does not produce a change in any state’s result – which few expect – this will not affect the Electoral College vote. The Electoral College vote is displayed in the hexagon-shape cartogram (shown in the bottom map). Here, each hexagon represents a federal state and is then resized according to the total number of votes that this state has in the Electoral College. Therefore, this map is an accurate depiction of the political realities that determine the vote of the next president. On a conventional map, in contrast, Trump’s defeat is relativised due to his largest success in some of the states with relatively large size but relatively low populations (and low Electoral College votes). Hence, these states become overrepresented in a normal map (shown in the top map). Yet neither land nor the electors provide a fully adequate representation of how the people voted, since both distort the population distribution of the electorate – as in 2016, when Trump won by tight margins, particularly in crucial ‘Rustbelt’ states despite losing the popular vote. The reality of how votes are distributed is best seen through a population-weighted cartogram where each state is proportional to the number of people who live in it (shown in the middle map). Florida is often seen as essential for any presidential victory. But that old maxim did not prove true this time around. Although Trump held ‘the Sunshine state’, he lost out in the three aforementioned tight states of Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Michigan and (very likely) also Georgia. Both the conventional map and the population cartogram also show a gradual colour scheme related to the overall vote share of the (projected) winning candidate. Here, further insights can be gleaned as to how divided the country really is, regardless of how decisive the outcome of the Electoral College may appear. Putting some of the respective strongholds of both parties aside – along the west coast and northeast for the Democrats, and across the central mid-western states for the Republicans – winning vote shares for either candidate were between 45 and 55 per cent, both in Southern states from Arizona to Texas and across the Rustbelt around the Great Lakes. Once the dust has settled on the heated atmosphere that characterised the early days after the election, the wider implications of a hugely divided country will be the largest challenge for the next presidency and most likely for many more to follow. The outgoing President may have changed US politics in the past four years, yet this was only made possible through the divisions that had been building up in American society long before Trump took the White House. This is the United States that Biden will inherit. Benjamin D. Hennig is Professor of Geography at the University of Iceland and Honorary Research Associate at the University of Oxford.

The discussion will focus on three key policy outcomes that Republicans have sought during the last six years: reforming the Federal Reserve, overhauling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and changing the way in which the nation\'s largest financial institutions are designated and regulated. As the curtain falls on the Obama presidency, historians have already begun to put the past Administration into a broader context. While only the Affordable Care Act will be identified by the former President\'s name—even Obama has embraced the Obamacare moniker—the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or Dodd-Frank, will figure prominently in any assessment of Obama\'s legacy. As with its older sibling, how Dodd-Frank is assessed will be a partial function of how much of it survives. Since before its enactment in July 2010, Republicans have been circling wagons to amend it, gut it, or repeal it. Now that the party has assumed control of both houses of Congress and the White House, some skeptics are ready to forecast the dismantling of Dodd-Frank. For support, they point to the Financial CHOICE Act, a piece of legislation introduced by Republicans in September 2016. 1 Not so fast. While the CHOICE Act would certainly amount to a wholesale repudiation and near complete repeal of Dodd-Frank\'s key provisions, a difficult political dynamic is underway that the election of Donald Trump complicates, rather than facilitates. At play is both an ideological difference in how the government should approach financial reform, but also institutional differences that have more to do with presidential politics than partisan ideology. SUMMARY • When it comes to financial regulation, many have assumed that the Trump Administration will now work in concert with a Republican-controlled Congress to repeal Dodd-Frank in full— a move anticipated in the CHOICE Act, a piece of legislation introduced by Republicans in September 2016. But there are reasons to believe that this will not be so straightforward.', 'Peter Conti-Brown'),

Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, type of location where injured, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics. Period Covered 2016. Description of System NVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, Supplementary Homicide Reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data collected from 32 states for 2016 (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates information for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, homicide followed by suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident. Results For 2016, NVDRS captured 40,374 fatal incidents involving 41,466 deaths in the 32 states included in this report. The majority (62.3%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides (24.9%), deaths of undetermined intent (10.8%), legal intervention deaths (1.2%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force acting in the line of duty, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (<1.0%). (The term legal intervention is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement.) Demographic patterns varied by manner of death. Suicide rates were highest among males, non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic whites, adults aged 45–64 years, and men aged ≥75 years. The most common method of injury was a firearm among males and poisoning among females. Suicides were most often preceded by a mental health, intimate partner, substance abuse, or physical health problem or a recent or impending crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were highest among males and persons aged <1 year and 15–44 years. Among males, non-Hispanic blacks accounted for most homicides and had the highest rate of any racial/ethnic group. The most common method of injury was a firearm. Homicides were most often precipitated by an argument or conflict, occurred in conjunction with another crime, or for females, were related to intimate partner violence. When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was known, the suspect was most frequently an acquaintance/friend among males and a current or former intimate partner among females. Legal intervention death rates were highest among men aged 20–44 years, and the rate among non-Hispanic black males was three times the rate among non-Hispanic white males. Precipitating circumstances for legal intervention deaths most frequently were an alleged criminal activity in progress, reported use of a weapon by the victim in the incident, a mental health or substance abuse problem (other than alcohol abuse), an argument or conflict, or a recent or impending crisis. Unintentional firearm deaths were more frequent among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged 15–24 years. These deaths most often occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and most often were precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded. Rates of deaths of undetermined intent were highest among males, particularly non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native males, and adults aged 25–64 years. Substance abuse, mental health problems, physical health problems, and a recent or impending crisis were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. In 2016, a total of 3,655 youths aged 10–24 years died by suicide. The majority of these decedents were male, non-Hispanic white, and aged 18–24 years. Most decedents aged 10–17 years died by hanging/strangulation/suffocation (49.3%), followed by a firearm (40.4%), and suicides among this age group were most often precipitated by mental health, family relationship, and school problems. Most suicides among decedents aged 18–24 years were by a firearm (46.2%), followed by hanging/strangulation/suffocation (37.4%), and were precipitated by mental health, substance abuse, intimate partner, and family problems. A recent crisis, an argument or conflict, or both were common precipitating circumstances among all youth suicide decedents. Interpretation This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2016. Suicides rates were highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and white males, whereas homicide rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. Mental health problems, intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, and acute life stressors were primary precipitating events for multiple types of violent deaths, including suicides among youths aged 10–24 years.

NVDRS data collection began in 2003 with seven states (Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia) participating; six states (Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) joined in 2004, four (California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah) in 2005, and two in 2010 (Ohio and Michigan), for a total of 19 states. This report includes data from 16 states that collected statewide data in 2010; data from California are not included in this report because data were not collected after 2009. Ohio and Michigan were excluded because data collection, which began in 2010, did not occur statewide until 2011.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor 2010, a total of 15,781 fatal incidents involving 16,186 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 16 states included in this report. The majority (62.8%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides and deaths involving legal intervention (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions) (24.4%), deaths of undetermined intent (12.2%), and unintentional firearm deaths (0.7%).

Homicides were precipitated primarily by arguments and interpersonal conflicts or in conjunction with another crime.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThis report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2010. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected persons aged <55 years, males, and certain minority populations. For homicides and suicides, relationship problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental health problems, and recent crises were among the primary precipitating factors. Because additional information might be reported subsequently as participating states update their findings, the data provided in this report are preliminary.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION\nFor the occurrence of violent deaths in the United States to be better understood and ultimately prevented, accurate, timely, and comprehensive surveillance data are necessary. NVDRS data can be used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths at the national, state, and local levels. NVDRS data have been used to enhance prevention programs. Examples include use of linked NVDRS data and adult protective service data to better target elder maltreatment prevention programs and improve staff training to identify violent death risks for older adults in North Carolina, use of Oklahoma VDRS homicide data to help evaluate the effectiveness of a new police and advocate intervention at domestic violence incident scenes, and data-informed changes in primary care practice in Oregon to more effectively address older adult suicide prevention. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS is essential to CDC\'s efforts to reduce the personal, familial, and societal impacts of violence. Further efforts are needed to increase the number of states participating in NVDRS, with an ultimate goal of full national representation.', 'S. Parks, Linda L. Johnson, D. McDaniel, M. Gladden'),

Surveillance summaries', 96, 'PROBLEM/CONDITION\nAn estimated 50,000 persons die annually in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC\'s National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 16 U.S. states for 2009. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, marital status, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.\n\n\nREPORTING PERIOD COVERED\n2009.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM\nNVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, and law enforcement reports. NVDRS data collection began in 2003 with seven states (Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia) participating; six states (Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) joined in 2004, four (California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah) in 2005, and two (Ohio and Michigan) in 2010, for a total of 19 states. This report includes data from 16 states that collected statewide data in 2009. California is excluded because data were collected in only four counties. Ohio and Michigan are excluded because data collection did not begin until 2010.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor 2009, a total of 15,981 fatal incidents involving 16,418 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 16 states included in this report. The majority (60.6%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides and deaths involving legal intervention (i.e., deaths caused by police and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions) (24.7%), deaths of undetermined intent (14.2%), and unintentional firearm deaths (0.5%). Suicides occurred at higher rates among males, non-Hispanic whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and persons aged 45-54 years. Suicides occurred most often in a house or apartment and involved the use of firearms. Suicides were preceded primarily by mental health, intimate partner, or physical health problems or by a crisis during the previous 2 weeks. Homicides occurred at higher rates among males and persons aged 20-24 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. The majority of homicides involved the use of a firearm and occurred in a house or apartment or on a street/highway. Homicides were preceded primarily by arguments and interpersonal conflicts or in conjunction with another crime. Characteristics associated with other manners of death, circumstances preceding death, and special populations also are highlighted in this report.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThis report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2009. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected adults aged <55 years, males, and certain racial/ethnic minority populations. For homicides and suicides, relationship problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental health problems, and recent crises were among the primary factors that might have precipitated the fatal injuries. Because additional information might be reported subsequently as participating states update their findings, the data provided in this report are preliminary.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION\nFor the occurrence of violent deaths in the United States to be better understood and ultimately prevented, accurate, timely, and comprehensive surveillance data are necessary. NVDRS data can be used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths at the national, state, and local levels. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS is essential to CDC\'s efforts to reduce the personal, familial, and societal costs of violence. Additional efforts are needed to increase the number of states participating in NVDRS, with an ultimate goal of full national representation.', 'D. Karch, J. Logan, D. McDaniel, S. Parks, N. Patel'),

Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1-6).† Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26-October 3, 2020. Expected numbers of deaths were estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns, using provisional mortality data from CDC\'s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (7). Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015-2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25-44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons.

On October 30, the number of new cases reported in the United States in a single day exceeded 100,000 for the first time, and by December 2 had reached a daily high of 196,227.* With colder weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing U.S. holiday season, and silent spread of disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons (2), the United States has entered a phase of high-level transmission where a multipronged approach to implementing all evidence-based public health strategies at both the individual and community levels is essential. This summary guidance highlights critical evidence-based CDC recommendations and sustainable strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission. These strategies include 1) universal face mask use, 2) maintaining physical distance from other persons and limiting in-person contacts, 3) avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces, 4) increasing testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 7) protecting essential workers with provision of adequate personal protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room air ventilation and enhancing hand hygiene and environmental disinfection, and 10) achieving widespread availability and high community coverage with effective COVID-19 vaccines. In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic\'s economic impact. Consistent implementation of these strategies improves health equity, preserves health care capacity, maintains the function of essential businesses, and supports the availability of in-person instruction for kindergarten through grade 12 schools and preschool. Individual persons, households, and communities should take these actions now to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its current high level. These actions will provide a bridge to a future with wide availability and high community coverage of effective vaccines, when safe return to more everyday activities in a range of settings will be possible.', 'M.

Morbidity and mortality weekly report', 49, 'Introduction Provisional estimates indicate that drug overdose deaths increased in 2019 after a slight decrease in 2018. In 2018, overdose deaths primarily involved opioids, with continued increases in deaths involving illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs). Deaths involving stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are also increasing, mainly in combination with opioids. Methods CDC analyzed data on drug overdose deaths during January–June 2019 from 24 states and the District of Columbia (DC) in the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System to describe characteristics and circumstances of opioid- and stimulant-involved overdose deaths. Results Among 16,236 drug overdose deaths in 24 states and DC, 7,936 (48.9%) involved opioids without stimulants, 5,301 (32.6%) involved opioids and stimulants, 2,056 (12.7%) involved stimulants without opioids, and 943 (5.8%) involved neither opioids nor stimulants. Approximately 80% of overdose deaths involved one or more opioid, and IMFs were involved in three of four opioid-involved overdose deaths. IMFs, heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine (alone or in combination) were involved in 83.8% of overdose deaths. More than three in five (62.7%) overdose deaths had documentation of at least one potential opportunity for overdose prevention intervention. Conclusions and implications for public health practice Identifying opportunities to intervene before an overdose death and implementing evidence-based prevention policies, programs, and practices could save lives. Strategies should address characteristics of overdoses involving IMFs, such as rapid overdose progression, as well as opioid and stimulant co-involvement. These efforts should be complemented by efforts to prevent initiation of prescription opioid and stimulant misuse and illicit drug use.', 'J. O’Donnell, R. Gladden, C. Mattson, Calli T Hunter, N.

US data on intussusception have been mostly related to RV5, with limited data on RV1.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe assessed intussusception events following RV1 reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a US national passive surveillance system, during February 2008-December 2014. We conducted a self-controlled risk interval analysis using Poisson regression to estimate the daily reporting ratio (DRR) of intussusception after the first 2 doses of RV1 comparing average daily reports 3-6 versus 0-2 days after vaccination. We calculated the excess risk of intussusception per 100,000 vaccinations based on DRRs and background rates of intussusception. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess effects of differential reporting completeness and inaccuracy of baseline rates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nVAERS received 108 confirmed insusceptible reports after RV1. A significant clustering was observed on days 3-8 after does1 (p=0.001) and days 2-7 after dose 2 (p=0.001). The DRR comparing the 3-6 day and the 0-2 day periods after RV1 dose 1 was 7.5 (95% CI=2.3, 24.6), translating to an excess risk of 1.6 (95% CI=0.3, 5.8) per 100,000 vaccinations. The DRR was elevated but not significant after dose 2 (2.4 [95% CI=0.8,7.5]).

Anaphylactic reactions are a widespread concern driving vaccine hesitancy due to the serious and potentially fatal nature of anaphylaxis. A quantitative estimation of the risk of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions deriving from mRNA vaccines is of a significant public health importance. Objective: To estimate the relative Reporting Odds Ratio of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions following mRNA vaccination vis-a-vis other vaccinations. Design: Reporting case-control study. Setting: Persons reporting adverse events following vaccination to VAERS whose reports were received between 01 January 2000 and 02 July 2021, inclusive. Patients: Each case of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction was matched with 2.7 unique controls on average, by gender and age rounded to the nearest integer. Measurements: Overall and stratified Reporting Odds Ratios (ROR) were calculated. Stratified contingency tables were tested for homogeneity using the Breslow-Day procedure, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics were calculated to test the hypothesis of a ROR of unity. Results: 2,665 cases of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions and 7,125 controls of non-anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reports were compared. The ROR of an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction was 1.325 (95% CI: 1.212 - 1.448, p < 0.001). The matched set of cases and controls did not reveal inhomogeneity by gender or age band strata, suggesting that these factors have no impact on the likelihood to report an anaphylactic event as opposed to a non-anaphylactic event following mRNA vaccination. A slightly elevated ROR was observed with patients who reported a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs and/or fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The precise meaning and relevance of this finding remains to be elucidated. Previous reactions to vaccines do not appear to correlate statistically significantly with a higher risk of reporting an anaphylactic adverse effect after mRNA vaccination. Limitations: As a reporting study using data from VAERS, our analysis is subject to under- and overreporting, the extent of each of which is not known with any degree of precision. Since the Emergency Use Authorizations for both mRNA vaccines mandate reporting of all serious adverse events, reporting bias is likely in favour of non- mRNA vaccines, where such reporting is not mandatory in adults. Consequently, this analysis may exaggerate the ROR of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events associated with mRNA vaccines, which may in reality be significantly lower. Conclusions: mRNA vaccination is not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of reporting an anaphylactic adverse event to VAERS. Anaphylaxis is a serious but very rare complication of all immunisations. No significant increase in reporting odds was found in any age group or gender, nor in most cases of previously known allergic adverse events in relation to vaccines. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence proving the safety and tolerability of mRNA vaccines.', 'C. von Csefalvay'),

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed reports to VAERS and available medical records of persons vaccinated with 2009-H1N1 and 2009-2010 seasonal influenza vaccines during July 1– November 30, 2009. We assessed the demographic and clinical characteristics of Bell’s palsy patients and the reporting rates of Bell’s palsy following these vaccinations. Results: We verified 65 cases Bell’s palsy after 2009-H1N1 vaccination and 31 cases after seasonal influenza vaccination. Characteristics of Bell’s palsy cases after 2009-H1N1 vaccination were comparable to those after seasonal influenza vaccination and those previously described for Bell’s palsy. The overall reporting rate was 2.6 times higher after 2009-H1N1 vaccination than seasonal influenza vaccination but substantially lower than background incidence rates.

Despite this recommendation, approximately 2.5 million doses of TT were distributed annually from 1991 to 1997. One possible explanation for the continued use of TT is concern about the relative safety of Td. Small clinical trials found Td to be associated with a higher rate of local vaccine-associated adverse events (VAEs) than TT. To determine if the findings from the trials would hold up on a larger scale, we compared the rate of reporting to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive reporting system, after either vaccine from 1991 to 1997. There were 40 reports per million doses of Td, and 27 reports per million doses of TT, for a reporting rate ratio of 1.4. Reporting rates to VAERS are lower than the rates of VAEs identified in the clinical trials, but the magnitude of the difference in VAEs following TT versus Td is similar. While reporting rates are lower after TT than Td, rates of reported VAEs after both vaccines are low.', 'J. C. Lloyd, P. Haber, G. Mootrey, M. Braun, P. Rhodes, Robert T. Chen'),

Hundreds of millions of vaccinations are administered in the United States each year. Serious adverse reactions are uncommon. However, temporally associated deaths can occur following vaccination. Our aim was to characterize main causes of death among reports submitted to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched VAERS for US reports of death after any vaccination from 1 July 1997 through 31 December 2013. Available medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates were reviewed to identify cause of death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nVAERS received 2149 death reports, most (n = 1469 [68.4%]) in children. Median age was 0.5 years (range, 0-100 years); males accounted for 1226 (57%) reports. The total annual number of death reports generally decreased during the latter part of the study period. Most common causes of death among 1244 child reports with available death certificates/autopsy reports included sudden infant death syndrome (n = 544 [44%]), asphyxia (n = 74 [6.0%]), septicemia (n = 61 [4.9%]), and pneumonia (n = 57 [4.6%]). Among 526 adult reports, most common causes of death included diseases of the circulatory (n = 247 [46.9%]) and respiratory systems (n = 77 [14.6%]), certain infections and parasitic diseases (n = 62 [11.8%]), and malignant neoplasms (n = 20 [3.8%]). For child death reports, 79.4% received >1 vaccine on the same day. Inactivated influenza vaccine given alone was most commonly associated with death reports in adults (51.4%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nNo concerning pattern was noted among death reports submitted to VAERS during 1997-2013. The main causes of death were consistent with the most common causes of death in the US population.', 'P. Moro, J. Arana, M. Cano, Paige W. Lewis, T. Shimabukuro'),

Surveillance summaries', 378, 'PROBLEM/CONDITION\nVaccines are usually administered to healthy persons who have substantial expectations for the safety of the vaccines. Adverse events after vaccinations occur but are generally rare. Some adverse events are unlikely to be detected in prelicensure clinical trials because of their low frequency, the limited numbers of enrolled subjects, and other study limitations. Therefore, postmarketing monitoring of adverse events after vaccinations is essential. The cornerstone of monitoring safety is review and analysis of spontaneously reported adverse events.\n\n\nREPORTING PERIOD COVERED\nThis report summarizes the adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2001.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS\nVAERS was established in 1990 under the joint administration of CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accept reports of suspected adverse events after administration of any vaccine licensed in the United States. VAERS is a passive surveillance system: reports of events are voluntarily submitted by those who experience them, their caregivers, or others. Passive surveillance systems (e.g., VAERS) are subject to multiple limitations, including underreporting, reporting of temporal associations or unconfirmed diagnoses, and lack of denominator data and unbiased comparison groups. Because of these limitations, determining causal associations between vaccines and adverse events from VAERS reports is usually not possible. Vaccine safety concerns identified through adverse event monitoring nearly always require confirmation using an epidemiologic or other (e.g., laboratory) study. Reports may be submitted by anyone suspecting that an adverse event might have been caused by vaccination and are usually submitted by mail or fax. A web-based electronic reporting system has recently become available. Information from the reports is entered into the VAERS database, and new reports are analyzed weekly. VAERS data stripped of personal identifiers can be reviewed by the public by accessing http://www.vaers.org. The objectives of VAERS are to 1) detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events; 2) monitor increases in known adverse events; 3) determine patient risk factors for particular types of adverse events; 4) identify vaccine lots with increased numbers or types of reported adverse events; and 5) assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring 1991-2001, VAERS received 128,717 reports, whereas >1.9 billion net doses of human vaccines were distributed. The overall dose-based reporting rate for the 27 frequently reported vaccine types was 11.4 reports per 100,000 net doses distributed. The proportions of reports in the age groups <1 year, 1-6 years, 7-17 years, 18-64 years, and >/= years were 18.1%, 26.7%, 8.0%, 32.6%, and 4.9%, respectively. In all of the adult age groups, a predominance among the number of women reporting was observed, but the difference in sex was minimal among children. Overall, the most commonly reported adverse event was fever, which appeared in 25.8% of all reports, followed by injection-site hypersensitivity (15.8%), rash (unspecified) (11.0%), injection-site edema (10.8%), and vasodilatation (10.8%). A total of 14.2% of all reports described serious adverse events, which by regulatory definition include death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or permanent disability. Examples of the uses of VAERS data for vaccine safety surveillance are included in this report.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nAs a national public health surveillance system, VAERS is a key component in ensuring the safety of vaccines. VAERS data are used by CDC, FDA, and other organizations to monitor and study vaccine safety. CDC and FDA use VAERS data to respond to public inquiries regarding vaccine safety, and both organizations have published and presented vaccine safety studies based on VAERS data. VAERS data are also used by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee to evaluate possible adverse events after vaccinations and to develop recommendations for precautions and contraindications to vaccinations. Reviews of VAERS reports and the studies based on VAERS reports during 1991-2001 have demonstrated that vaccines are usually safe and that serious adverse events occur but are rare.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS\nThrough continued reporting of adverse events after vaccination to VAERS by health-care providers, public health professionals, and the public and monitoring of reported events by the VAERS working group, the public health system will continue to be able to detect rare but potentially serious consequences of vaccination. This knowledge facilitates improvement in the safety of vaccines and the vaccination process.', 'W. Zhou, V. Pool, J. Iskander, R. English-Bullard, R. Ball, R. Wise, P. Haber, R. Pless, G.

Although these outcomes are commendable, we suggest that this intubation bundle or checklist could be improved by the inclusion of preparatory elements in the pre-intubation phase of the bundle. Difficult airway evaluation and the organisation of equipment, such as working suction, appropriate laryngoscopes, oropharyngeal airways and endotracheal tubes, is a prerequisite in all patients [2]. Most of this essential equipment can be pre-assembled in intubation packs, which could include a checklist in order to save time. The authors suggest that standard operating procedures for intubation are employed in the operating room but are lacking in intensive care units (ICU). Common, standard operating procedures for intubation in both environments are likely to reduce opportunities for error; however, some aspects of this procedure, such as patient positioning, may be different in the ICU. Jaber and colleagues do not specify the patients’ position during intubation. Generally this procedure is both taught, and undertaken, with the patient supine and a pillow or wedge under the occiput to flex the cervical spine, whilst the head is extended at the atlanto-occipital joint. However, providing the individual is not grossly hypotensive, we suggest that critically ill patients should be routinely intubated in the semi-recumbent position. Functional residual capacity (FRC) varies with body position, decreasing as a person moves from a sitting to a supine position [3]. Whilst of little consequence in pre-oxygenated healthy individuals, in critically ill patients who are hypoxaemic, adopting the supine position can result in dramatic oxygen desaturation. Moreover, as the FRC acts as an oxygen reserve during apnoea induced by anaesthesia, the supine position limits the effectiveness of pre-oxygenation (even with noninvasive ventilation). Consequently, following induction, the time available for intubation prior to desaturation is shorter in the supine than in the semi-recumbent position. Obese individuals are particularly vulnerable to these effects: preoxygenation of such patients in the sitting position rather than the supine position significantly extends their tolerance to apnoea [4]. Another advantage of semirecumbent positioning is that laryngeal exposure is superior to that in the supine position. Lee et al. [5] demonstrated that during laryngoscopy of 40 patients, the percentage glottic opening score was significantly better in the 25 back-up position than in the flat supine position. An improved view of the larynx has the potential to reduce the number of difficult, oesophageal or failed intubations. The semirecumbent position is also associated with less risk of gastric aspiration and ventilator associated pneumonia. Finally, as semi-recumbent positioning is an essential element of the ventilator care bundle, it obviates inadvertent omission from the latter.', 'P. Frost, C. Hingston, M. Wise'),

This type of ventilation introduces a more physiological breathing pattern than traditional types of mechanical ventilation. It has been shown to improve oxygenation and ventilation in various animal models of lung injury when compared with conventional monotonous assist control ventilation (AC).1-3 \n \nWe report our preliminary experience with BVV in eight critically ill patients. With BVV, the ventilator is configured so that the product of the respiratory rate and tidal volume is constant. The average coefficient of variation in the size of tidal volume was 30%. \n \nThe local Research and Ethics Board of the University of Manitoba approved this study in February 2006, and informed consent was obtained from the patients’ legal representatives. The eight patients in this study were intubated and ventilated for at least 72 hr in the medical or surgical intensive care units at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg. Their baseline ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was 100-300 mmHg. The study was conducted as a crossover trial with patients acting as their own control. The patients were randomized to begin with either BVV or AC, and their lungs were ventilated for a four-hour period in each mode of ventilation. \n \nThe baseline tidal volume was set at 6 mL·kg−1 to comply with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) protocol. The patients were switched to a modified Esprit® ventilator (Respironics, Carlsbad, CA, USA) that could be controlled by computer software. The computer ran a variability file that was recorded from a healthy individual and consisted of 1,489 breaths. Arterial blood gases, static lung compliance, and dead space (VD/VT) were measured every hour. After completion of the study, the patients were returned to their baseline mode of ventilation. Continuous variables were compared using repeated measures one-way analysis of variance with post hoc least squares matrices to enable between group and within group comparisons. For within group comparisons, a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used. \n \nNone of the patients required an increase in FiO2 or change in the level of positive end-expiratory pressure during the study. There was improvement in the oxygen index (FiO2 × mean airway pressure × 100 /PaO2) after four hours of BVV compared with AC (7.1 vs 11.5 cm H2O·mmHg−1, respectively; P = 0.034) (Figure). There was no statistically significant change in arterial PaCO2 after four hours of BVV. The VD/VT ratio decreased after four hours of BVV compared with AC (0.64 vs 0.68, respectively; P = 0.017) and lung compliance improved (0.36 vs 0.34 mL·cm H2O−1·kg−1, respectively; P = 0.049). \n \n \n \nFigure \n \nOxygen index vs time. The oxygen index (FiO2 × mean airway pressure × 100/PaO2, expressed in cm H2O·mmHg−1) in patients ventilated with biologically variable ventilation (BVV) compared with ... \n \n \n \nA series of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the improved ventilation with BVV in the setting of ARDS. A presumed mechanism is thought to be enhanced alveolar recruitment. Evidence for alveolar recruitment with BVV has been shown by computed tomography scanning in a porcine model of ARDS.3 If alveoli can be recruited and kept open, improved gas exchange and lung compliance would be expected with BVV. By using a variety of tidal volumes and respiratory rates, the probability of selecting the appropriate time constant for a given subpopulation of alveolar units is greatly increased. Recent editorials advocate for the role of “noisy” or physiological variability to aid ventilation of patients.4,5 This pilot project suggests that BVV may warrant further study as a mode of ventilation in patients who require controlled ventilation.', 'S.

She breathed fast, as if she had been running. I arrived at her bedside short of breath myself, summoned stat by the ICU nurse. Two days earlier we anticipated this moment would come. We’d seen the large blood clot in her heart on echocardiogram: a time bomb. Flapping precariously, the clot threatened to break free and wedge itself into a major blood vessel in the lungs. It was a recipe for sudden cardiac death, with a little respiratory failure thrown in. The blood thinners we’d prescribed were unlikely to dissolve such a large clot, especially given the bad humors in her blood from her cancer. The respiratory therapist popped his head into the room. ‘‘Want to intubate her, doc?’’ Putting a tube into a gasping person’s airway is like scratching an itch for an ICU physician. It’s what we do. We’re trained for it and more—to drag life back from the precipice using all the expensive paraphernalia of intensive care. Trouble breathing? I can put a tube in a lung within seconds. I can ventilate the patient with a bag and mask at 12 breaths per minute. Flagging blood pressure? Pressor medications will tighten up your vessels and pump up the pressure. Our feet are forever on the starting blocks, waiting like a sprinter for the gun to go off. Every second counts for the 40-year-old otherwise healthy woman with a serious pneumonia or the 28-year-old man hit by a bus. But Mrs. S was a different and a much more common story. Spinal metastases had continued to grow despite multiple trials of chemotherapy. Strong opiates didn’t stop the gnawing pain punctuated by startling knifelike jabs as the hungry cancer digested healthy bone. Connecting her to a ventilator would just buy time. But for what? Forced to lie still on her breaking back, tape steadying the breathing tube snaking its way into her lungs through her mouth, she’d be tied to the bed, alone, probably until her death. And so it was with great relief that I knew the answer to the respiratory therapist’s question. ‘‘No, we won’t be intubating her. Let’s give her a dose of the morphine and see how she feels.’’ Earlier, on the day of the echocardiogram, I had met with the patient and her family at the bedside to deliver the bad news. We had reached the end of the line for treatments for her cancer. The chemotherapy wasn’t working, the cancer continued to worsen. Now there were other life-threatening complications. The clot was enormous; when it broke off, it would cause either respiratory distress or a cardiac arrest. Intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were options, but they all agreed that there would be no benefit, only a prolongation of dying. Mrs. S and her family processed the limitations and risks and decided that attempted resuscitation efforts would not be in her best interest. The respiratory therapist nodded. ‘‘Good decision, doc.’’ In the spirit of my specialty, I gave her extremely aggressive care. I monitored her respiratory rate and distress constantly for the first hour and treated her with medications to relieve her shortness of breath. Once she was stable, I changed the room from one that had focused on machines, catheters, and alarms into one that provided a peaceful, calm haven for this woman at the end of her life. A fan blew air gently on her face. Music played on the radio, which her family had brought in days before. Her daughter sat in a chair next to the bed, her head on her mother’s lap, holding her hand. The patient died peacefully two days later.', 'J. Zitter'),

Because alcohol abuse independently increases the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in at-risk individuals, we hypothesized that donor alcohol use is correlated with an increased risk of PGD. As a pilot study, we collected alcohol use histories using a validated instrument, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test questionnaire, from 74 donors and correlated these with the development of PGD in corresponding recipients. Nineteen percent (14/74) of donors were classified as heavy alcohol users, as defined by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test scores $8. In the 1st 4 days posttransplantation, similar percentages of recipients developed grade 3 PGD on at least 1 day (heavy alcohol user 5 29% [4/14] versus lighter alcohol user5 27% [16/60]); however, recipients receiving a lung from a heavy alcohol user were more likely to have multiple and consecutive days of grade 3 PGD, especially in the 1st 48 hours post-transplant. Both median length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were somewhat longer in the heavy alcohol user group (9 versus 7 days and 19.5 versus 17.5 days, respectively). If these preliminary findings are validated in a multi-center study, they would have important implications not only for our understanding of the pathophysiology of PGD but also for the development of novel treatments based on the evolving evidence from experimental and clinical studies on how alcohol abuse renders the lung susceptible to acute edematous injury. Key Indexing Terms: Primary graft dysfunction; Lung transplantation; Lung donor; Recipient; AUDIT; Alcohol use. [Am J Med Sci 2015;349 (2):117–123.] P rimary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the leading cause of death in the immediate period following lung transplantation and has an incidence of 15% to 25%. Unfortunately, there are no effective therapies, and even with supportive care, the mortality can be as high as 43%. It had previously been assumed that the factors predisposing to PGD pertain to the surgical procedure or to the allograft recipient. However, compelling experimental and clinical evidence suggests that donor-related risks factors are also important in the development of PGD. For example, it is now recognized that donor characteristics, such as age, smoking and mismatches with the donor in sex or race, contribute to poor recipient outcomes. We recently demonstrated a potential association between elevated donor levels of receptor for advanced glycation end-products and the development of PGD. In addition, other studies have shown that donor biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-8, vascular endothelial growth factor and certain gene expression profiles are associated with an increased risk of developing PGD. Importantly, because there are no proven medical treatments for PGD, identification of additional biomarkers to accurately identify allografts that are at higher risk for developing this serious condition are needed. The features of PGD represent essentially a form fruste of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury (ALI), which occurs within the unique context of lung transplantation. In the past 15 years, a strong independent association between alcohol abuse and ARDS has been identified, and our group at Emory University has been at the forefront of investigating the mechanisms by which alcohol abuse renders the lung susceptible to acute edematous injury. Specifically, alcohol abuse independently and significantly increases the risk of ARDS 2to 4-fold in critically ill individuals. Although the mechanisms underlying this association are still being investigated, we have clear evidence from experimental models and clinical studies that chronic alcohol ingestion causes oxidative stress and depletes the pool of the antioxidant glutathione within the alveolar space. Alcoholinduced oxidative stress causes previously unrecognized alveolar epithelial dysfunction, including increased paracellular permeability, decreased liquid clearance, impaired surfactant production and decreased cell viability. This “alcoholic lung” phenotype is clinically silent in that the physiological perturbations identified in both experimental models and in otherwise healthy alcoholic individuals are not readily detectable without sophisticated measurements and do not manifest as significant lung dysfunction until an acute inflammatory stress, such as sepsis or aspiration, unmasks them. Specifically, alcohol abuse alone does not cause lung injury but rather it significantly lowers the threshold for its development. This previously unrecognized association between alcohol abuse and ARDS/ALI was identified only when prospective studies were done using accurate alcohol use assessments such as the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). However, this type of prospective investigation has not heretofore been applied in the unique context of lung transplantation and PGD. Therefore, we sought to determine if donor alcohol abuse likewise increased the risk of PGD. As a 1st step and a means of identifying biological plausibility, we demonstrated that chronic alcohol use by the donor exacerbated airway injury in allograft recipients using an experimental From the Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care and the Florida Hospital Heart/Lung Transplant Programs (AP), Orlando, Florida; Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine (POM, NSS, DMG), Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia; Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center (POM, DMG), Decatur, Georgia; Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery (SDF), Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (LE), Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia; and Department of Pediatrics (LASB), Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.

We then initiated a single-center pilot study within our Emory Alcohol and Lung Biology Center, in collaboration with the McKelvey Center for Lung Transplantation at Emory University, to collect preliminary data in support of such an association that could stimulate the design and implementation of a larger multi-center study. Such information would have enormous implications for both the selection of lung allograft donors and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to mitigate the devastating consequences of PGD. We reasoned that this study was important to the lung transplant community, which includes donors, recipients and the tens of thousands of healthcare professionals involved in lung transplantation. Unfortunately, despite advances in lung transplantation techniques and identification of appropriate selection criteria, our ability to predict which lung allograft recipients will develop PGD is at present imprecise, and our limited understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving the development of PGD has frustrated our attempts to identify effective therapies beyond supportive care. In light of recent experimental and clinical evidence revealing the strong and independent association between alcohol abuse and ALI, we felt that there were compelling reasons to examine whether donor alcohol abuse increased the risk of PGD. To address this hypothesis, we initiated a pilot study at Emory University through our Alcohol and Lung Biology Center to study the relationship between donor alcohol use and the development of PGD in lung transplant recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Donor and Recipient Characteristics Eligibility Between February 2007 and January 2009 at Emory Hospital in Atlanta, GA, 88 consecutive lung transplant recipients and their lung donors were considered for eligibility. Exclusion criteria included being re-transplanted (n 5 4), no consent (n 5 2) and improper lung preparation (n 5 3). Two subjects received a lung from the same donor; 1 subject was randomly selected for inclusion in the analysis. Therefore, in total, there were 78 eligible lung allograft recipients, of whom 74 had their donor’s alcohol use quantified using the AUDIT. All analyses are based on these 74 recipients. Donor Lung Criteria Lung donors were recruited from brain-dead patients consented for lung donation. Donor lungs used for transplantation at our institution had to meet the following inclusion criteria at the time of organ recovery: (1) compatible ABO blood group, (2) PaO2/FiO2 . 300 mm Hg, (3) chest radiograph without focal or significant findings consistent with pneumonia or lung contusion and (4) adequate bronchoscopic assessment was performed to ensure that no obvious aspiration was present. Explanted lungs were preserved using Perfadex (Vitrolife, Gothenburg, Sweden). The allograft ischemia time was recorded for all lung transplants. Lung Recipients Criteria Recipients listed at our institution received transplants according to their clinical priorities. Clinical data were available for all lung transplant recipients. Th', 'A.

To examine levels of pollution in urban birds of prey in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada, we analyzed persistent organic contaminants in adult birds found dead of trauma injury. The hepatic geometric mean concentration of sum polybrominated diphenyl ethers (∑PBDEs) in 13 Cooper\'s hawks (Accipiter cooperii) from Greater Vancouver was 1873 ng/g (lipid weight) with one bird reaching 197,000n g/g lipid weight, the highest exposure reported to date for a wild bird. Concentrations of ∑PBDEs, ∑PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and, surprisingly, cyclodiene insecticides were greatest in the urban environment while those of DDE (1,1-dichloroethylene bis[p-chlorophenyl) were highest in a region of intensive agriculture.

Nocturnally migrating birds are attracted to and disoriented by artificial lighting, making light pollution an important factor in collision mortality, and there is growing interest in mitigating the impacts of light to protect migrating birds. We use two decades of data to show that migration magnitude, light output, and wind conditions are important predictors of collisions at a large building in Chicago and that decreasing lighted window area could reduce bird mortality by ∼60%. Our finding that extinguishing lights can reduce bird death has global implications for conservation action campaigns aimed at eliminating an important cause of bird mortality. Millions of nocturnally migrating birds die each year from collisions with built structures, especially brightly illuminated buildings and communication towers. Reducing this source of mortality requires knowledge of important behavioral, meteorological, and anthropogenic factors, yet we lack an understanding of the interacting roles of migration, artificial lighting, and weather conditions in causing fatal bird collisions. Using two decades of collision surveys and concurrent weather and migration measures, we model numbers of collisions occurring at a large urban building in Chicago. We find that the magnitude of nocturnal bird migration, building light output, and wind conditions are the most important predictors of fatal collisions. The greatest mortality occurred when the building was brightly lit during large nocturnal migration events and when winds concentrated birds along the Chicago lakeshore. We estimate that halving lighted window area decreases collision counts by 11× in spring and 6× in fall. Bird mortality could be reduced by ∼60% at this site by decreasing lighted window area to minimum levels historically recorded. Our study provides strong support for a relationship between nocturnal migration magnitude and urban bird mortality, mediated by light pollution and local atmospheric conditions. Although our research focuses on a single site, our findings have global implications for reducing or eliminating a critically important cause of bird mortality.', 'Benjamin M. Van Doren, D.

Information was obtained through semi-structured interviews from each individual. A total of 13 wild bird species, distributed among six orders and six families, were identified; the Columbidae family was the best represented in terms of the numbers of species. Zenaida auriculata was cited most. The birds were captured using five techniques: “arapuca” (a non-lethal fall-trap), “espera” (waiting in a blind), “sangra” (a non-lethal fall-trap), “fojo” (dead-fall), and “rede” (netting); ‘Waiting in a blind’ was the technique most cited. The use of wild birds as sources of food, together with the general lack of population studies of hunting species is associated with other environmental problems that can be expected to directly or indirectly affect their populations.

Recoveries on bird colonies are often ignored in survival studies because the river reach of mortality is often unknown, which we model as a form of state uncertainty. Median outmigration survival from release to the lower river (river kilometre 729 to 75) ranged from 0.27 to 0.35, depending on year. Recovery probabilities were frequently ≥0.20 in the first river reach following tagging, indicating that one out of five fish that died in that reach was recovered on a bird colony.

Ants directly impact the dead wood environment primarily through nesting in standing dead trees, logs, stumps, and coarse and fine woody materials, contributing to the physical breakdown of woody materials. Ants indirectly impact the dead wood environment through predation of a wide variety of arthropods, particularly termites, and by serving as a food source for other animals, particularly birds (woodpeckers) and bears that physically break down dead wood to prey upon ant colonies. The known impacts of ant nesting and predation in dead wood are reviewed with a case study that provides new information on the role of abiotic factors affecting nesting site location in dead wood in the eastern temperate US forests. Results showed horizontal and vertical nest stratification of ant nests that shifted with spatial scale. At broad scales, climate determines disparate ranges among species across a latitudinal gradient. At the scale of a forest floor, however, microsite temperature, moisture, and biotic interactions affect nesting locations in downed logs. Future research aimed at better understanding the interactions between ants and other organisms in dead wood environments is necessary to improve our understanding of the importance of ants in shaping dead wood communities and ecosystem processes like decomposition.

However, ants commonly nest and forage within downed and standing dead wood and have been shown to be the most, or among the most, abundant animal taxa in those environments (Wilson 1959; Lindgren and MacIsaac 2002; King et al. 2013). The term “saproxylic” refers to any species that depends either directly or indirectly on dying or dead wood, and thus this chapter is focused primarily upon ant activities in dead wood. Ant activity in live trees and shrubs (including myrmecophytic trees) and in ecosystems largely devoid of dead wood (e.g., some grasslands, deserts) is not considered. Globally, forests sequester ~50% of the world’s terrestrial carbon (Mahli 2002), with dead wood constituting 10–20% of this C (Weedon et al. 2009). In certain regions, dead wood can account for 20–30% of the forest C stock and as much as 40% of forest respiration (Pan et al. 2011). Controls on the decay rate and partitioning of this dead wood pool are affected by organismal interactions in the dead wood environment, and understanding these interactions refines both regional and global C budgets (Boddy et al. 2008; Cornwell et al. 2009; Crowther et al. 2012; Warren and Bradford 2012; Bradford et al. 2014; Maynard et al. 2017). Ant activities in dead wood are important controls in forest ecosystems at all latitudes where standing and downed dead wood is abundant (Warren and Bradford 2012; Bradford et al. 2014; Parr et al. 2016). Recent work has shown that wood-rot fungi and termites are key interacting players in determining the rate of wood decomposition at local scales in many forest ecosystems and that ants interact with both fungi and termites—and a multitude of other organisms– in dead wood environments (Abe et al. 2000; Warren and Bradford 2012; Bradford et al. 2014; Maynard et al. 2015; Neupane et al. 2015; Parr et al. 2016). Little is known, however, about the activity of ants in dead wood —which presents a major gap in our understanding of the natural history and ecology of this key group of organisms and their effects on a central, global ecosystem function: decomposition of dead wood. Here we review existing knowledge of the activities and impacts of ants in dead wood, present evidence of factors affecting the movement of and location of ant colonies in dead wood in eastern US temperate forests, and suggest key research needs to improve our understanding of the role of ants in shaping conditions and communities in dead wood environments. 8.1 Impacts of Ants in Dead Wood 8.1.1 Nesting Ecology Ant nests take a number of forms, ranging from arboreal nests in preformed cavities in living trees, carton nests formed from processed (e.g., chewed and mixed with saliva or bound with silk) vegetative material, nests in soil or rock cavities, and nests in dead woody material of all sizes.

This is the case of bird collisions with human built structures, estimated to claim billions of victims every year around the world. Between April 2006 and November 2008, we recorded collisions of 106 individuals of 18 species, including 11 species of boreal migrants and 7 resident species, with windows of six buildings in the campus of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá; 88% of all collisions were fatal to the birds. We found that windows through which birds could see vegetation beyond were more dangerous (73% of all collisions recorded) than those which simply reflected vegetation or the sky, and that the number of collisions peaked during the period of fall migration by boreal breeders. Extrapolating our study of collisions at six buildings, we estimate that ca. 271 collisions could occur annually over the entire campus. We invite others to extend these observations and to collect as scientific specimens the casualties so they can serve as a source of information on patterns of migration, expansion of distribution ranges and potential national and global threat for some species.

Bird-window collisions in a city on the Iberian Mediterranean coast during autumn migration. Revista Catalana d’Ornitologia 33:17-28 Very few monitoring studies in Europe, with the exception of papers on collisions with highway noise barriers. Abstract: Collision with buildings is a major threat to birds that provokes the death of millions of birds every year in built-up areas. Despite its magnitude, this phenomenon remains poorly studied in Europe. We studied bird-window collisions during postnuptial migration in the city of Tarragona (NE Spain). We surveyed a 15-m-high residential building in the city centre with a reflective façade for 189 days during postnuptial periods in 2012– 2015. We found 172 dead birds belonging to 15 species, most of them migratory. Blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla, Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus and Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca were the commonest casualties, representing 72% of all recovered bird corpses. Once the uneven sampling effort between days and years was corrected for, we estimated that the total number of fatalities during the study period was 350 birds (SE=22.2). However, this figure is probably an underestimate due to certain biases in sampling carcasses in a city including collection by pedestrians or removal by cleaning services and owners. Overall, there was a patent seasonal pattern to the collisions, with a peak around 1 October, probably reflecting the timing of migration in the species present at the site. There were no differences in either age, sex or biometrics between the birds found in Tarragona and those trapped on the same days at a ringing station in the Ebro Delta, 60 km to the south-west. This suggests that the probability of collision affected all migrants in a uniform fashion. Our study demonstrates for the first time that bird collisions with buildings are a serious threat to migrants in the Mediterranean, a key area for bird migration in Europe.

Vegetation on and around large-scale buildings positively influences native tropical bird abundance and bird species richness. Urban Ecosystems 22(2):213-225. In response to habitat loss caused by urbanization in the tropics, planners and architects are creating networks of greenspaces, including green roofs, walls and gardens. This study in Singapore investigated whether these areas have a positive impact on native or introduced bird species. Roof gardens and green walls on large-scale buildings supported a higher richness of birds and abundance of urban native birds than control roofs and walls without vegetation. Ground gardens supported similar levels of native species as roof gardens but also a larger proportion of non-natives. No tropical forest habitat specialists were reported from any of these spaces. Specific heights and plant species supported different bird taxa. The authors suggest that these ecological requirements for different species groups are considered when designing a building’s green space. Banks, R. C. 1976. Reflective plate glass a hazard to migrating birds. BioScience 26(6):414. Banks notes that large-scale mortality caused by collisions with man-made structures such as lighthouses and communications towers has received great notice for over century, whereas smaller-scale and “less spectacular” deaths of individual birds from collisions with plate glass has received relatively little attention. He suspects the collective toll of the latter is significant and may in fact be greater than that caused by the more noted episodic mortality associated with towers and skyscrapers. This may be the first assertion of this in the scientific literature. Banks notes that reflective plate glass is becoming a popular feature of office parks and similar structures constructed near vegetated areas. He expresses concern that the proliferation of such buildings will lead to increased migrant mortality. Banks, R. C. 1979. Human related mortality of birds in the United States.

PLoS ONE 12(6): e0178667. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178667 Abstract Wildlife residing in urban landscapes face many human-related threats to their survival. For birds, collision with glass on manmade structures has been identified as a major hazard, causing hundreds of millions of avian fatalities in North America every year. Although research has investigated factors associated with bird-glass collision mortality at buildings, no prior studies have focused on bird fatalities at glass-walled bus shelters. Our objectives in this study were to describe the magnitude of bird-bus shelter collisions in the city of Stillwater, Oklahoma and assess potential predictors of collision risk, including characteristics of shelters (glass area) and surrounding land cover (e.g., vegetative features). We surveyed for bird carcasses and indirect collision evidence at 18 bus shelters over a five-month period. Linear regression and model selection results revealed that the amount of glass on shelters and the area of lawn within 50 m of shelters were both positively related to fatal bird collisions; glass area was also positively associated with observations of collision evidence on glass surfaces. After accounting for scavenger removal of carcasses, we estimate that a minimum of 34 birds are killed each year between May and September by collision with the 36 bus shelters in the city of Stillwater. While our study provides an initial look at bird fatalities at bus shelters, additional research is needed to generate a large-scale estimate of collision mortality and to assess species composition of fatalities at a national scale. Designing new bus shelters to include less glass and retrofitting existing shelters to increase visibility of glass to birds will likely reduce fatal bird collisions at bus shelters and thus reduce the cumulative magnitude of anthropogenic impacts to birds in cities.

To this end, Usborne has made the desktop version freely available from their website. (https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/). It was created by a diverse group of producers, designers, and developers with the lead game developers and designers listed as Berbank Green and Jonathan Skuse from the Popleaf Software development company. The development team also included educational consultants from UK post secondary institutions specializing in early literacy and digital games. The series is broken into the following games: Game 1: First Steps For children just starting to learn letters and sounds, Game 2: Fun With Words, and Game 3: Champion Reader. For ease of use by parents and teachers, there is a detailed break down of the letter-sound combinations, words and sentences covered in each game, including a PDF overview. (https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/about-the-game/what-does-each-game-cover). For the purposes of this review, my 5-year-old son and I looked at the app version of the first game.  Like many children’s apps and games, it begins with the opportunity to customize your avatar, in this case a monster. It also builds upon this theme with an interactive rewards system offering a choice of accessories or virtual treats for their monster every time they have learned a new grapheme and when a “world” has been completed. The monster has crashed its spaceship on an alien planet and the king has offered to fix it if he retrieves all of his lost letters. The story set up is concise and does not interfere with getting started but it is also engaging and is woven throughout the levels in an effective way that changes slightly with each level (in terms of the graphics and the activities that are available), yet the narrative and gameplay retains elements of previous worlds so as to provide consistency and ease of navigation.  There is a wide variety of “mini games” to choose from as players are learning each grapheme; new ones are added in each world but previous ones are still available. The game adjusts to the learner; graphemes which were not identified correctly are repeated more often. It is brilliantly scaffolded: following the grapheme minigames, players practice blending sounds to make words, identifying challenging “non decodable words” and breaking down or “segmenting” words into sounds. The graphics are colourful, bold and visually appealing to children. Other enhancements such as sound effects and narration are extremely effective and add to the learning and gaming experience. Our one point of criticism is that the grapheme sound in the “run” mini game is slightly less audible than some of the other sound effects (i.e. background music, “jumping” sound, etc.). However, the player is given several opportunities to hear it. \nTeach Your Monster to Read has a Teacher Area and is designed to be used in the elementary school classroom. It has options for account creation with options for teacher and/or parent monitoring of child progress. The fact that the online/desktop version is freely available is great news for non-profit literacy centres and libraries whose patrons include families who might not have access to the app.  A truly impressive multimedia experience in all respects, which reflects the experience and creativity of the development team: https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/about-us. Although the Apple App stores lists the recommended age as 4+, I would suggest visiting the website as it states that is designed to cover “two years of the reading journey” and, as mentioned above, provides a very thorough breakdown of what is covered in each game with the first one beginning at Pre-K “learning sounds”. Therefore, parents and teachers can determine the appropriate age for each game based on individual ability and prior exposure to early literacy activities. \n \nHighly Recommended: 4 out of 4 starsReviewer: Kim Frail \nKim is a Public Services Librarian at the H.T.

The timelines and processes outlined are not in dispute; however, we would question some of the authors’ subsequent inferences. As a Society2, we believe the pendulum of endovascular repair (EVAR) vs open aortic aneurysm repair (OAR) may have swung too far towards EVAR, and this view is in line with the 2018 draft recommendations from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Our concerns at that time (shared by Getting It Right First Time, the CRG, the British Society of Interventional Radiology, British Society for Endovascular Therapy and patients) was the absolutist and binary approach found in the draft guidelines. We felt they failed to recognize the evolution of stents, the often complex clinical judgement and most importantly, the role of the patient in the decision-making process. We cannot ignore the fact that many fully informed abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients will have a preference for EVAR and its lower short-term risks, while accepting the fact that further treatment may be required in future. Subsequent and unusual steps taken by NICE recognized the serious concerns raised by all stakeholders, including patients. Publication of the pragmatic final guidelines reflects the validity and importance of these concerns, and is much more closely aligned to the European Society for Vascular Surgery and North American guidelines. NICE have yielded to pressure received through feedback on the draft guidance from multiple stakeholders (listed above). We agree with the authors that ‘if guidelines simply make vascular surgeons think more carefully before using an EVAR device off IFU [manufacturer’s instructions for use], they will have been worthwhile’. The Vascular Society feels the vascular multidisciplinary team will be the decision-making tool to implement the current guidelines and this will be monitored via the National Vascular Registry (NVR). For cases outside standard IFU, younger and fitter patients should be considered for open surgery. However, custom EVAR is acknowledged as being a vital option in some cases and the Vascular Society encourages enrolment of such patients into studies such as the UK Compass study, and recording outcomes on the NVR. Prospective monitoring of the shortand long-term outcomes of such devices is vital and we endorse this NICE recommendation. The Audit and Quality Improvement Committee has been working hard on recording device specific identifiers for both endovascular stent-grafts and conventional vascular grafts within the NVR. Furthermore, changes to allow the capture of longterm outcomes including reintervention and revision have been devised for the aortic data set. These changes will go live in 2020, and in time will become a vital source of information on the durability of aortic repair. We acknowledge that NICE was in a difficult position when the published data used in its own processes resulted in a conclusion that seemed to be at odds with contemporary global expert opinion and recently published guidelines from Europe and the USA. We believe it was correct to listen to the opinion of patient groups regarding the importance of patient choice, and to clinical experts who pointed to difficulties in implementing the draft guidance. NICE should be congratulated and not criticized for the pragmatic amendments to the final guidelines. We agree that this has been a painful process that has already resulted in vascular surgeons reassessing decisionmaking for intervention in patients with AAA, as demonstrated by the lower proportion of AAA repairs being performed by EVAR in the most recent NVR annual report3.', 'C.

We use methods that our research team is well versed in. The quantities elicited relate to a set of key uncertainties identified in a previous piece of work— Claxton et al.—which evaluated the available evidence on health opportunity costs (HOC) for the UK National Health Service (NHS), a quantity that is important for supporting policy decisions over investments using public health system funds. Claxton et al. identified evidence on the effects of changes in expenditure on the life year burden of disease but no evidence on the likely effects of expenditure on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Linking the effects of expenditure on mortality burden of disease to QALYs is hence the focus of our work. The letter commends our study for its policy value and for its methodological quality and rigor but, at the same time, raises methodological concerns. The authors provide no references to support their view that these concerns minimize the policy relevance of our findings. In this letter, we respond to these concerns. The first methodological concern regards the expertise of the individuals recruited, and we rebut this on 3 grounds. First, health care practitioners (the substantive experts recruited into this study) directly observe the health effects of the activities of the health system (linked to expenditure), and hence we argue they are best placed to evaluate the quantities of interest. Second, we followed best practice in including, in our sample of experts, representatives with specialism in all the different clinical areas of interest (e.g., cardiologists, who have the relevant experience in circulatory disease) and also individuals with expertise across clinical areas (e.g., general practitioners, radiologists, anesthetists, and public health specialists). The authors claim that those without a specialism have no expertise, but this is incorrect as these individuals complement those with specialisms by providing breadth across the different clinical areas, across the types of technologies and services covered by NHS expenditure, and across settings of care. Finally, the authors claim the policy experts possess no substantive expertise. This is true and has been made clear in our study: policy experts were convened separately and asked to elicit by reconciling the information elicited from clinical experts with their own judgments. The fact that some drew entirely on the judgments of substantive clinical experts is a result in itself and was expected, indicating that these individuals trust the judgments of individuals with substantive expertise. This does not, in any way, impair the validity of the elicitation exercise. The second claim by the authors is that the elicited quantities are not meaningful. It should be noted that our article carefully lays out the definitions of the quantities elicited, and in supplementary material, we provide the extensive materials used for training the experts and the full questionnaire used in the elicitation. A number of arguments were presented supporting the authors’ claim. It is asserted that we have not used an existing framework for elicitation, such as the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF).

After similarly reading their article3 published in the same issue, we also wished to comment on that. Theprimaryobjectiveof ourworkwas toassess the relevanceof the current SIOP criteria for deciding the indication of diagnostic needle biopsy in pediatric renal tumors. SIOP recommendations include clinical criteria, in particular the patient’s age at diagnosis, but also biological and radiological criteria. In their comments, Jackson et al suggest that the cutoff agewe proposed (nine years) indicating a decreased probability of Wilms tumor (WT) could be inappropriate, as it was based on a single-institution study and due to the data discretization method we used. Based on larger series, their data actually suggest a 10-year cutoff. We were quite amazed by this comment because we included, fairly, in the discussion section that “if confirmed by a larger series, this information should be taken into account to adjust SIOP criteria.” It is just basic statistics to assume that the larger the cohort, the more accurate the criterion. Essentially, we think that the most interesting fact is that two independent andexperiencedoncological teams reached the same conclusion from two independent data sets, i.e., that the classical sixyear SIOP criterion should be adjusted on the basis of new epidemiological data. Hence, we would like to take this opportunity to suggest that the SIOP-RTSG address this issue on the basis of the whole SIOP database,whichwill bemuch larger thanboth the series that havebeen published. Regarding the question of primary surgery for “small” tumors, we agree that tumor size is not the only risk factor of peroperative rupture. The surgeon’s experience is also a very important factor, although much more difficult to quantify. However, the absolute tumor volume was clearly identified as the main risk factor4 as well as the volume ratio between the tumor and the abdominal cavity.5 The UKW3 data analysis actually demonstrated fewer surgical complications in children given preoperative chemotherapy before surgery compared with children undergoing immediate nephrectomy, especially for tumor rupture,6 in agreementwith the early results of SIOP trials.7 Nevertheless,wemust acknowledge that theoutcome in termsof event-free and overall survival for patients treated in SIOP and COG’s trials are very similar, although COG’s strategy has always been based on upfront surgery.8 We did not state that upfront surgery should be considered for all children with “small” tumors. We only demonstrated a link between initial tumor volume and histology (i.e., WT vs non-WT), even after adjustment for age at diagnosis, and suggested that the tumor volume might be included in SIOP criteria after assessment on a larger study. Jackson et al rightly pointed out that the distribution of tumor volumes shows that both clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and WT may be large at presentation and claim that our results were not supported by statistical analysis. We disagree and would like to insist that our data does support a statistically significant link between initial tumor volume and histology. In the discussion, we also fairly assumed that there was still some overlap of phenotypical features, especially between WT and CCSK, both being usually large masses at diagnosis. However, in contrast, a “small” tumor volume should be regarded as a possible non-WT. This criterion was never suggested in the literature and in our opinion should be further investigated in order to define a cutoff below which WT should be regarded as less probable. According to our data, a 70-mL cutoff would be the optimal value (ROC curve analysis: AUC = 0.71 95% CI: 0.66–0.77) but we instead decided, in agreement with reviewers, to suggest addressing this issue through a larger series in order to obtain more statistical power. We think this criterion could be especially helpful with patients aged around the new 9or 10-year threshold to better discriminate between WT and juvenile renal cell carcinoma, the latter being usually smaller than WT at presentation. As Jackson et al rightly mentioned, this differential diagnosis is of theutmost importance for avoidingunnecessary chemotherapy and allowing timely surgical resection. Jackson et al also suggested that we overstated the utility of fineneedle aspirates (FNA) for replacement or adjunct core needle biopsy (CNB). In our article, we did not suggest replacing CNB. Instead, we demonstrated the significantly higher diagnostic accuracy of CNB compared with FNA. However, we also reported the relative accuracy of FNA which had been used as the only diagnostic method in the past at Institut Curie. We confirmed the usefulness of FNA in addition to CNB especially when CNB provides nondiagnostic material that can occur even when biopsies are image guided and performed by trained hands, such as in 36 of 552 (6.5%) of the UKW3 series3 and in 7 of 88 (8%) of ours.

I have been trained in Endocrinology and Obesity in the USA and in the UK in various very strong and respectable institutions. Obviously, this is not the point of the letter, but, since we all doctors like to be evidence based in what we write and declare, I believe I have met so many teachers and instructors that my sayings can be statistically significant, at least in the measurement of one variable, that is the quality of the teacher. I met Carel after a recommendation letter from Barts Endocrine. Carel from time zero was friendly, smiling and welcoming. Immediately, he gathered the whole team and introduced me to everyone, as at the time, he was leading the Bariatric Preand Post-operative Unit of Imperial College of Medicine, under Sir Prof. Bloom. Within a couple of hours, I realised that the same attitude applied to all of his colleagues, the youngest being nurses and medical students and the older being full professors. I met a whole well-organised team, with a wonderful combination of professionalism, happiness, British sense of humour and collaboration. A team well built under Carel, leaving all the space to everyone to grow his/her academic potential, but on the same time being supervised discretely. I really admired the potential of Carel in knowing what everyone was doing in a certain time, but in a way that it never disturbed the individual initiative and thought. We worked in Carel together in the trials of the GLP-I agonists, very ahead of their time, now being one of the cornerstones of treatment for appetite and obesity. We published together (inObesity Surgery, as well [2]) and his response and timing in checking a manuscript is rarely seen from a senior. Years after, as per his suggestion, I became an International SCOPE Fellow in Obesity. As a member in the Board of Directors in the Hellenic Association for Obesity, I had the pleasure to welcome him on behalf of my country, Greece, to provide a lecture in Athens. It sounds Greek to you?Well, not for Carel, he can fit everywhere, teaching molecular pathways in a manner simple and understood by everyone. I still recall the Friday morning meetings, where everyone could express his personal opinion and perspective regarding the patients or the research. I still recall his fantastic South African accent, reminding me of the French who speak English with a certain class. Unfortunately, nowadays we evaluate doctors by clicks in PubMed and by citations. As said earlier, I truly believe in evidence as well, and evidence shows that Carel is not only a qualified researcher, but also a very potent clinician, a good teacher and reliable friend.

Those hosts, however, don’t always appreciate the company, mounting immune responses to keep invaders in check. Sometimes that leads to severe illness, but not always—hosts can be infected without displaying any clinical symptoms. Such viruses carry on undetected, though they may in fact be influencing their hosts in subtle ways. As metagenomics technologies advance that enable detection of novel microbes in the environment, such asymptomatic infections are increasingly turning up in laboratory animals, with potentially confounding effects on various phenotypes that researchers are growing increasingly aware of. Yet there is still much to learn about how animal hosts and the pathogens that infect them interact and co-evolve. A new paper from Nels Elde’s lab at the University of Utah provides takes that work to the level of a whole organism: the zebrafish. Elde’s lab specializes in the evolution of host–pathogen conflict, but much of their work has been done in mammalian cell cultures, says postdoctoral research Keir Balla. Those are powerful systems, but they can lack the larger biological context that comes from studying a whole animal. To start exploring that context, they’ve turned to the zebrafish. “It’s such a versatile model of vertebrate biology, but it is somewhat under-explored in terms of infection biology,” says Balla. Previously, Balla had studied natural infections and immunity in another whole organism: C elegans. With the worms, he could carefully control exposure to different pathogens of interest while keeping other variables in check. “We know everything that the worm is interacting with in the laboratory environment,” says Balla, “That’s much harder to control for fish.” That may be a disadvantage for some areas of research, but not necessarily for studying host–pathogen interactions. “There were already infectious microbes— in particular viruses—hanging out in the laboratory environment that people weren’t aware of,” he says. “That turned into the opportunity to explore this messy environment, even within the laboratory, and to find some interesting host–pathogen interactions.” But first, they needed a way to detect any infections occurring in their zebrafish. You can’t always distinguish an infected fish by appearance says Balla, and unlike for bacteria and fungi where there are means to detect non-specific infections, no such general markers existed for detecting unknown viruses. They decided to make the immune system itself the marker, generating transgenic zebrafish that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in response to the release of interferon. The interferon system, Balla explains, is a first line of immune defense for all jawed vertebrates: when pattern recognition molecules detect a potential pathogen, interferon proteins are produced that notify the rest of the immune system to the presence of the invader. “We use this alarm system as the main signaling platform,” says Balla. While Balla and his colleagues were confirming that their isg15:GFP transgenic fish indeed expressed GFP as intended when interferon-expressing plasmids were injected into them, the team noticed that untreated control fish were also taking on a greenish glow, particularly in environment-exposed tissues such as the intestine and epithelial surfaces. Sequencing of RNA sampled from various GFP-positive, GFP-negative, and wildtype fish revealed the presence of a novel zebrafish picornavirus, ZfPV. ZfPV turned out to be endemic to the Utah zebrafish facility—and it also turned up in 92 existing RNA-seq datasets from research facilities across the world that had been deposited in the NIH Sequence Read Archive. Among those, the researchers detected several biological replicates with gene expression patterns that varied with the presence of ZfPV. That observation adds to the growing list of asymptomatic infections in various laboratory species that can potentially confound phenotypes without causing overt illness. In their current paper, Balla and his colleagues then used the zebrafish to experimentally study viral transmission, showing that standard egg bleaching protocols can prevent naturally occurring ZfPV infections and that infected larvae can horizontally transmit the virus to any uninfected individuals with which they are co-housed. Balla is now using the new zebrafish to further explore the nature of host–pathogen interactions, with plans to expand to other environments outside the lab, such as pet shops. “We know there are a lot of close relatives of zebrafish that are commonly traded,” he says, offering the opportunity to study a wider range of potential pathogens and how those might adapt from one host species to another. More broadly, the results underscore the importance of the microbiome and the microbial interactions that contribute to an organism’s development and health. “By tapping into all of these interactions that are important for zebrafish biology, I think this just adds a nice layer to that thinking,” he says. Though any viruses that manage to evade the interferon system will remain undetected with at least this particular model, the isg15:GFP transgenic zebrafish can serve two purposes, acting as sentinels to the presence of novel viruses while offering researchers a means to visualize host immune response to those same infections. “Because we use the host response as a way to find the virus, we’ve merged those concepts,” says Balla, connecting viral discovery to host–pathogen interactions in one whole organism.', 'Ellen P.

Sathanapally et al. reference the fact that 49% of foundation trainees had never rotated through a urology firm in their undergraduate years.1 This is an increasing problem as Benson, in a US-based study in 1994, demonstrated that 15% of new graduates had never experienced a rotation in urology.9 This is compounded by the fact that as undergraduate and foundation year exposure to the specialty diminishes traditional roles such as catheterisation will be increasingly performed by nurse practitioners. This does not change the fact that catheter issues are common, and therefore it is in the interest of trusts to ensure levels of competency and confidence in handling all catheter types.

In most modern video games and in simulation software, the set of content shipped with the product is static and unchanging, or at best, randomized within a narrow set of parameters. However, ideally, if game content could be constantly and automatically renewed, players would remain engaged longer. This paper introduces two novel technologies that take steps toward achieving this ambition: 1) a new algorithm called content-generating NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (cgNEAT) is introduced that automatically generates graphical and game content while the game is played, based on the past preferences of the players, and 2) Galactic Arms Race (GAR), a multiplayer video game, is constructed to demonstrate automatic content generation in a real online gaming platform. In GAR, which is available to the public and playable online, players pilot space ships and fight enemies to acquire unique particle system weapons that are automatically evolved by the cgNEAT algorithm. A study of the behavior and results from over 1000 registered online players shows that cgNEAT indeed enables players to discover a wide variety of appealing content that is not only novel, but also based on and extended from previous content that they preferred in the past. Thus, GAR is the first demonstration of evolutionary content generation in an online multiplayer game.

While this practice is fairly standard, it is unclear if it can introduce significant error. Modern technology has seen the increased use of recorded video by society to more objectively document notable events. Stationary mounted cameras, cell-phone cameras, and law enforcement officer Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) are increasingly used by society for this purpose. Video used in this way can often clarify or contradict recall from memory. BWCs are currently not widely used by EMS. The hypothesis is that current EMS documentation practices are inaccurate and that BWCs will have a positive effect on documentation accuracy. Methods: This prospective, observational study used a convenience sample of paramedics in a simulation lab. The Paramedics wore a BWC and responded to a simulated call of “One Down” (unresponsive from heroin abuse) involving Role Players (RPs). The paramedics received standardized cues from the RPs during the simulation to keep it on track. The simulation contained many factors of concern (e.g., weapons and drugs in plain view, unattended minors, etc.) and intentional stressors (e.g., distraught family member, uncooperative patient, etc.). Upon completion of the scenario, paramedic documentation occurred from memory on an electronic template. After initial documentation, paramedics viewed their BWC recording and were allowed to make tabulated changes. Changes were categorized by a priori criteria as minor, moderate, or major. Results: Ten paramedics participated with an average age of 33.3 years (range 22–43), 8 males and 2 females. The average length of paramedic career experience was 7.7 years (range 2 months to 20 years). There were 71 total documentation changes (7 minor, 51 moderate, 13 major) made after video review. Linear regression (ANCOVA) indicated changes made indirectly correlated with years of experience (coefficient 8.27, 4.22–12.3, 95% CI, p = 0.002), but all made some changes. Conclusion: Current EMS documentation practices demonstrate significant inaccuracy regardless of years of experience. Use of BWC technology appears to significantly improve EMS documentation accuracy in this pilot study.', 'J. Ho, D. Dawes, Evan M McKay, J.

Here is the life of a high-tech industry giant. The co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, Noyce co-invented the integrated circuit, the electronic heart of every modern computer, automobile, cellular telephone, advanced weapon, and video game. With access to never-before-seen documents, Berlin paints a fascinating portrait of Noyce: an ambitious and intensely competitive multimillionaire who exuded a just folks sort of charm, a Midwestern preacher\'s son who rejected organized religion but would counsel his employees to go off and do something wonderful, a man who never looked back and sometimes paid a price for it. In addition, this vivid narrative sheds light on Noyce\'s friends and associates, including some of the best-known managers, venture capitalists, and creative minds in Silicon Valley. Berlin draws upon interviews with dozens of key players in modern American business-including Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, Gordon Moore, and Warren Buffett; their recollections of Noyce give readers a privileged, first-hand look inside the dynamic world of high-tech entrepreneurship.

This unending transformation has resulted in palpable physical and emotional distancing between attackers and their targets. At their inception, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) appeared as the next evolution in this process, providing near complete physical isolation between combatants. Yet, there exists anecdotal and medical evidence indicating RPA aircrew are experiencing mental reactions to warfare as strong as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The confusing array of fact and opinion on this subject demands a further inquiry focused specifically on the characterization of psychological responses to killing from RPA aircrew. This study provides a characterization of the psychological responses to killing among MQ-1/9 pilots and sensor operators who have employed weapons and killed via remote combat. Additionally, it analyzes MQ-1/9 aircrews overall mental engagement with combat operations, their understanding of warfare despite the distances involved, and the relation of video games to this form of aerial warfare. This study should lead to better understanding of RPA aircrew and concepts regarding the character of modern warfare.', 'Joseph L Campo'),

There is virtually no difference today between piloting a virtual vehicle in a video game or training simulation or piloting a real one.

In this case, the motion parameters consist of the position, velocity, acceleration, attitude and angular velocity. This helmet tracker system consists of two infrared CCD sensors, several infrared LEDs on the helmet, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a computer for tracking. Our Helmet tracking system has a framework with a two-channel motion filter structure. The two channels, one for the optical measurement from the image sequence of CCD sensors and the other for the inertial measurement from the IMU, process independently with different sampling rates. With this hybrid system, we can overcome the failure in tracking a rapid motion and the accumulated error from the inertial sensors. Because of the nonlinearity in the state model, we implemented the system with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF has two channels for measurement that share a common prediction module. We implemented the real system and conducted the simulation with the real sensor data. INTRODUCTION Due to the rapid development of the avionic system with modern high techniques, aircraft pilots face a problem in that the complexity in using the system reduces the pilots’ ability in concentrating on attacking targets in battles or controlling aircraft. Many technologies have been developed to address this problem. If a pilot can control the targeting system or the avionic system without seeing the control panel, the pilot can greatly improve his capability to focus on the problem at hand. In this case, the key solution of this problem is to estimate the motion of the pilot, especially the motion of the pilot’s head. The helmet tracker system has been developed to estimate the motions of a head in a military fields. The helmet tracker system is very useful not only in military fields, such as a weapon cueing system, but also in the fields of augmented reality such as headmounted display. We can describe the helmet tracker with sensors mounted in the system. The magnetic helmet tracker has the advantages of small head-mounted sensors and high accuracy; however it is sensitive to the distortion by metallic objects. The optical helmet tracker has the advantage of low cost; however it is hard to implement because of the high computational expense. With the advancements in computing technology and current digital imaging equipment, researchers have actively studied the optical helmet tracker system. However this system still has problems in robustness that cause some serious failures and in high computational expenses. Especially in the case of tracking a rapid motion, the low sample frequency (lower than 30 Hz) can cause failures in tracking. To overcome this rapid motion problem, we have extended our previous work of the optical helmet tracker system to the hybrid tracer system with two measurement channels of optical and inertial sensors. The inertial sensors are widely used for motion tracking. These sensors are self-contained and can be sampled at high rates (less than 1 kHz). This second feature of the inertial sensors makes them suitable for sensing rapid motion. However, inertial sensors measure angular rates and accelerations, so the data from the inertial sensors should be integrated to produce the position or the orientation of the device. The noise or bias in the sensor signal integration produces a drift in the attitude computation that accumulates with elapsed time. To correct this accumulated drift, periodic measurements from other sensors need to provide the absolute pose data. In this paper, some image processing algorithms are used to produce this absolute pose data. HYBRID HELMET TRACKING SYSTEM Hardware Design The hybrid helmet tracker system consists of two infrared CCD cameras (VCC-S70) and infrared LEDs attached on the helmet, XSens MTx inertial measurement unit(IMU), Matrox Meteor2-MC/4 frame grabber and a computer for the tracking algorithm. Figure 1 illustrates the hybrid helmet tracker system. The data from the IMU and the video images from the cameras are transmitted to the desktop computer through the cables. The video images from the two cameras are digitized to a resolution of 640x480 pixels. Measurements Our hybrid head tracker system has two measurements, one from the image sequence and the other from the IMU. The measurements from the image sequence are the attitude and the position of the helmet, not the position of features in the image plane. The infrared stereo cameras detect the infrared LED features on the helmet, and by using the infrared LEDs, the lighting condition and the viewing direction can be controlled independently. The features are separated from the background by the threshold in gray image space. Due to the high contrast of the features, we can simply and robustly extract the features from the images. After the processing with these extracted features, we can obtain the 3-D position data of the point sets indexed with the model that we obtained by 3-D scanning of the helmet. We can then estimate the attitude and the position from the comparison with the 3D position data of the point sets of the model. We use these attitudes and positions as image measurements. The inertial sensors deliver linear acceleration and angular velocity in three orthogonal coordinate directions aligned with the IMU. We directly use these angular velocity and acceleration as inertial measurements. To estimate the velocity and the position, integration over time has to be performed. When we use the inertial sensors, we need to know the scale factor and the bias. Then we can obtain these parameters with calibration. In this study, however, instead of calibrating IMU by ourselves, we use the calibrated data offered by MTx. These two measurements process independently with different sample rates. The sample rate of the image processing is 30 Hz, and the sample rate of the IMU is 100 Hz in our experimental setup. IMAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHM Figure2 shows the flow chart of our image processing algorithm. In preprocessing, we have to calibrate the camera. We extract the feature with the threshold and with the masking technique of the image plane. Then we can obtain the 2-D point sets in the image plane. By using the epipolar line, the Hausdorff distance and the camera calibration information, we can transform the 2-D point sets of two images to 3-D point sets. After the model indexing, we can obtain ‘N’ reliable 3-D point sets indexed with the model. We can then calculate the attitude and the position of the helmet frame. A more detailed image processing technique is introduced later in this section. Figure 1: Composition of the hybrid helmet tracker Figure 2: Flow chart of the image processing algorithm Figure 3: Feature point in the image Figure 4: Stereo Matching with MHD Camera Calibration Camera calibration has been studied extensively, and the standard technique has been established. In this study, we use the stereo camera calibration with Bouguet’s camera calibration toolbox (Bouguet, 2006). The calibration uses images of a checkered target in several positions and recovers the cameras’ intrinsic parameters, as well as the extrinsic parameters between the two cameras. Feature Segmentation Figure 3 shows the image from the camera and the LED-marked feature at an enlarged pixel resolution. The LED-marked features are easily recognizable and are separated from the background without the need of defined lighting conditions. A further advantage is that the rotationally symmetric LEDs do not change their appearances much in the observations from different directions. Because of the high contrast, features are separated from the background by applying the threshold in gray image space. After the dilation process for robustness, Gaussian mask is used to determine the center of the segmented features. The equations for this are as follows: ( ) , ( , ) ( , ) ( , )', 'Se-jong Heo, Ok-Shik Shin, Chan Gook Park'),

The limitations of political decisions surrounding vaccines are due to the application of punitive measures such as administrative penalties and licensing bans for doctors who express anti-vax ideas, aspects which may increase distrust towards the political establishment and the medical profession.', 'Valentina Sbocchia'),

However, high-content imaging instruments are expensive, sophisticated, and not readily accessible. Herein, we report on a laser scanning cytometry approach that exploits a bench-top microarray scanner as an end-point reader to perform rapid and automated fluorescence imaging of cells cultured on a chip.

Performing parallel radiobioassays is highly desirable for saving time/effort, reducing experimental variation between assays, and minimizing the cost of the radioisotope. Continuously infused microfluidic radioassay (CIMR) is one of the useful tools for investigating cellular pharmacokinetics and assessing the binding and uptakes of radiopharmaceuticals. However, existing CIMR systems can only measure the dynamics of one sample at a time due to the limited field of view (FOV) of the positron detector. To increase the throughput, we propose a new CIMR system with a custom-built miniaturized panel-based positron-emission tomography (PET) scanner and a parallel infusion setup/method, capable of imaging the cellular pharmacokinetics of three samples in one measurement. With this system, the pharmacokinetics of parallel or comparison samples can be imaged simultaneously. The increased throughput is attributed to two innovations: 1) the large 3D FOV of the mini-panel PET scanner, enabling more samples to be imaged in the microfluidic chip; and 2) a parallel infusion method, in which only one reference chamber is needed for indicating the dynamic input of the infused radiotracer medium, thus saving the total reference chambers needed compared to the current sequential infusion method. Combining the CIMR technique and the mini-panel PET scanner, this study also firstly demonstrated the feasibility of using PET, as an imaging modality, for microfluidic radiobioassays. Besides the increased throughput, the 3D imaging of PET also provides possibilities for further applications such as organoid/3D culturing systems, non-planar microfluidics, and organs-on-chips. The system is more practical for a broader range of applications in nuclear medicine, molecular imaging, and lab-on-a-chip studies.', 'Zhen Liu, Pengfei Zhang, Hao Ji, Yu Long, Boping Jing, L.

The KidzMeds project was established ‘For all children to get the right medicine at the right dose at the right time with the right monitoring with minimum fuss wherever they live.’ Tablets are safer, more convenient and cheaper than liquid medications. Children often remain on liquid due to habit, reluctance and parental and staff not knowing how to convert. The idea of converting came from initial HIV medications which were only available in tablets1; children as young as 3 years could be taught.2 3 Aim Quality improvement project to teach children and young people (CYP) on long term medication how to take tablet medication in an out-patient setting. Method Working with families and our teams we created an interactive training package with video (http://northernpaediatrics.com/kidzmed/) and comic poster. We ran interactive hour-long training sessions for staff. Using positive reinforcement and play, the trainer sat facing the learner with sweets or dummy filled capsules of increasing sizes, from size 3 (15 mm) to size 00 (23 mm). Over the next 12 weeks in one team we embedded a process for children ≥5 years attending complex renal clinics to be converted from liquid to tablet medication unless contraindicated (e.g. swallowing or cognitive impairment). Outcome measures included successful conversion rate, patient and staff feedback and cost savings. We overcame practical barriers by placing easily accessible ‘switching kits’ in clinic filled with the necessary dummy pills, awards and certificates. To increase confidence, we created a sealed dosette box with common medications so children could see the size of tablets they needed to swallow. Working with the clinical team we standardised processes (e.g. how to round doses, pre-screening clinic lists and creating prompts). Results Over three months, 90 CYP were seen in 13 multi-disciplinary renal clinics, 25 were suitable for conversion to tablet medication. 21 CYP (median age 8.4 years range 5.1 to 15.5) were successfully converted (only one patient required two sessions). 36 medicines were switched, generating £46,500 per year recurrent savings. Feedback was good. Staff liked the opportunity for positive interaction with children and families appreciated the ease of obtaining tablet medications versus liquids. We subsequently trained other teams, including our research team who were recruiting for a study in which swallowing tablets is an inclusion criteria. Conclusions In a short timeframe it is possible to embed a system to convert children to tablet medication, improving patient experience and realising considerable cost savings. It requires staff training and cultural change. Pill swallowing is an easy skill to teach and learn and children as young as five can successfully swallow pills. We automatically teach inhaler technique so equally we should teach CYP how to swallow tablets as a skill for life. We would encourage all units to set up pill swallowing training.

In this essay, David Gurney examines how Te Gregory Brothers draw upon news coverage and other online videos as raw material for satirically remixed and reconfgured takes on current events and Internet culture. Amidst the sights and sounds of Katy Perry’s “California Gurls,” Usher’s “OMG,” and other bubbly hit songs of summer 2010, one unique single and its accompanying video experienced an unexpected moment in the spotlight with its AutoTuned chorus of lines including “Hide yo kids / Hide yo wife” and the repeated “We gon fnd you / We gon fnd you” becoming instant catchphrases in the pop lexicon. “Bed Intruder Song” by Te Gregory Brothers and Antoine Dodson was not novel in terms of its use of synthesizers, drum machines, or even Auto-Tune pitch-correcting sofware, but rather because of the original source of its vocal tracks. Lifed from a recording of television news originally broadcast by a local NBC afliate (WAFF in Huntsville, Alabama), the unintentional catchphrases began as statements from Antoine, whose family’s home had been broken into by a perpetrator intent on sexually assaulting one of its female members. Despite sampling’s long history in hip-hop, this peculiar source and the extended use of the sample made this a standout track. For Te Gregory Brothers, however, repurposing television news was not so unusual even if it represented a shif from appropriating the words of the powerful to the words of the relatively powerless. A media phenomenon like “Bed Intruder Song” underscores that when we talk about television in the twenty-frst century, we are talking less about a specifc media technology and a circumscribed set of behaviors surrounding it, than about an ever-expanding constellation of technologies associated with an increasingly less cohesive set of practices.

This postulation can be explored through Michel Foucault’s medical gaze theory and Mary Douglas’s cultural theory on dirt. The utilization of anthropological and philosophical theories, applied to Dr. Pimple Popper, can give us answers about how Dr. Lee’s patients are affecting the way viewers make sense of their own bodies through visually graphic material.

Although the video game industry does not accept the WHO’s decision to class GD as a genuine mental disorder, there is now arguably an onus on the video game industry to develop and undertake responsible gaming initiatives aimed at player protection and harm minimization. The present paper argues that the gaming industry does not have to “reinvent the wheel” as there are many responsible gaming tools and initiatives used by the gambling industry that they could implement (e.g., limit-setting, self-exclusions, personalized messaging, pop-up reminders). The paper also argues that like the gambling industry, the video game industry has an abundance of high-quality data in the form of player account data (i.e., behavioral tracking data) and that researchers should work collaboratively with the gaming industry to use such data to learn more about the acquisition, development, and maintenance of gaming and GD among its clientele. It is also noted that while there is the need for such cooperation, the integrity of independent research should not be jeopardized nor undermined in this process. In addition to the clear need of establishing a scientific partnership between gaming operators and researchers, the paper also outlines several steps and recommendations to improve the overall quality of research in GD.', 'M.

Furthermore, it was hypothesized that parents’ alcohol consumption, as perceived by the adolescents, would moderate these indirect associations. Using cross-sectional survey data from 259 high school students, parents’ references to the negative consequences of alcohol use were related to weaker pro-alcohol norms, and in turn, weaker alcohol-use intention. By contrast, parents’ conditional permissive messages and references to drinking responsibly were related to stronger pro-alcohol norms, and in turn, stronger alcohol-use intention.

How Language Use in a Peer-to-peer Online Discussion Forum Predicts Risky Drinking among Those in Recovery', '2018', 'Health communication', 17, 'ABSTRACT Increasingly, individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) seek and provide support for relapse prevention in text-based online environments such as discussion forums. This paper investigates whether language use within a peer-to-peer discussion forum can predict future relapse among individuals treated for AUD. A total of 104 AUD sufferers who had completed residential treatment participated in a mobile phone-based relapse-prevention program, where they communicated via an online forum over the course of a year. We extracted patterns of language use on the forum within the first four months on study using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a dictionary-based text analysis program. Participants reported their incidence of risky drinking via a survey at 4, 8, and 12 months. A logistic regression model was built to predict the likelihood that individuals would engage in risky drinking within a year based on their language use, while controlling for baseline characteristics and rates of utilizing the mobile system. Results show that all baseline characteristics and system use factors explained just 13% of the variance in relapse, whereas a small number of linguistic cues, including swearing and cognitive mechanism words, accounted for an additional 32% of the total 45% of variance in relapse explained by the model. Effective models for predicting relapse are needed. Messages exchanged on AUD forums could provide an unobtrusive and cost-effective window into the future health outcomes of AUD sufferers, and their psychological underpinnings. As online communication expands, models that leverage user-submitted text toward predicting relapse will be increasingly scalable and actionable.', 'R. Kornfield, Catalina L. Toma, Dhavan V. Shah, T.

It is also linked to over 200 disease and injury conditions and is associated, for example, with liver cirrhosis, cancers, and alcohol dependence. \n \nThe Irish drink a lot, and in particular, binge drinking is very high here compared to other countries, at 39 per cent of people. Alcohol Action Ireland remarked that this ‘puts Ireland just behind Austria with 40.5 per cent at the top of the 194 countries studied and well ahead of our neighbours in Britain at 28 per cent’. \n \nThe costs are large. Almost 10 per cent of Irish children say that their parents’ use of alcohol has negative effects on their lives, for a total of 110,000 children. As many as 25 per cent of injuries admissions to hospitals’ emergency departments are related to alcohol, which is also strongly linked to suicide, especially among young men. 88 deaths every month in Ireland are directly caused by alcohol, along with 1,200 cases of cancer each year. One in four deaths of men younger than 40 years old is due to alcohol, as are a third of road accidents. 2,000 hospital beds are occupied for reasons related to alcohol, and treating related injuries and diseases costs about €1.2 billion, or 8.5 per cent of the annual health care budget. \n \nMoreover, the health and crime problems linked to alcohol cost us €3.7 billion a year.

This paper reviews published research on the ability of consumers to utilise information about the alcohol content of beverages when expressed in different forms, for example in standard drinks or units versus percentage alcohol content.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nA review of the literature on standard drink definitions and consumer understanding of these, actual drink pouring, use of standard drinks in guidelines and consumer understanding and use of these.\n\n\nRESULTS\nStandard drink definitions vary across countries and typically contain less alcohol than actual drinks. Drinkers have difficulty defining and pouring standard drinks with over-pouring being the norm such that intake volume is typically underestimated. Drinkers have difficulty using percentage alcohol by volume and pour size information in calculating intake but can effectively utilise standard drink labelling to track intake. Standard drink labelling is an effective but little used strategy for enabling drinkers to track their alcohol intake and potentially conform to safe or low-risk drinking guidelines.', 'W. Kerr, T.

First, the alcohol industry continues to be powerful and savvy. Industry advertising never says that alcohol is not addictive; rather, the message is “use responsibly,” which implies that alcohol’s use—unlike the use of drugs—is controllable. Second, although the proportion of Americans drinking has remained steady at about two in three people over the past 70 years, Americans are drinking more, and more easily. Third, during this decade of economic expansion, many Americans have more income. In contrast to the stereotype, affluent people are more likely to drink than low-income people. Fourth, binge-drinking is now a rite of passage in college. With women a growing percentage of collegiate heavy drinkers, and with alcohol-makers targeting women with sweeter and fizzier products, health risks accumulate among women, who generally experience greater alcohol effects at lower doses than men. Fifth, Americans have become complacent about driving under the influence, because seatbelts and safer cars have lowered alcohol-related fatalities. Yet, paradoxically, alcohol-related traffic accidents are on the rise. Consuming less alcohol in total or on a per-occasion basis would probably improve the health of most people. That is a credible and reasonable public health goal.', 'M. Stein, S. Galea');
